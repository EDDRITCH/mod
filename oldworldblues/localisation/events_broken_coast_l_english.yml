 nf_event_brk.1.t:0 "Our Ancestors"
 nf_event_brk.1.d:0 "After the great war, the natural protection of the mountainous coasts became home to a group from which all others adapted to their culture. Some Marines from before the war, stationed defending from the invading Chinese survived in the mountains after the bombs fell. Various vessels, finding themselves stranded became shelter against the harsh winters for their crews. Natives of the land previously under occupation also gained their freedoms here after the bombs fell. All of these people form the fabric of the people in the Broken Coast, but the first group from which all others were assimilated were..."

 nf_event_brk.2.t:0 "The Great Blizzard"
 nf_event_brk.2.d:0 "After the bombs fell, the effects did not leave. A great blackness engulfed the sky, blocking out the sun and casting a great blizzard upon the people in the Coast. Many died in the cold, their corpses freezing from the extreme cold in a matter of minutes. Out of the ashes, a people born from cruelty managed to survive this by..."

 nf_event_brk.3.t:0 "Why we Fight"
 nf_event_brk.3.d:0 "Our ancestors fought and bled for the Broken Coast. The old ways are going and the new ways will lead us to glory. But we need to focus on building ourselves up. What should we focus on?"
 nf_event_brk.3.a:0 "Slaves"
 nf_event_brk.3.b:0 "Wealth"

 nf_event_brk.4.t:0 "Raids into Alvin Bleak"
 nf_event_brk.4.d:0 "We hit their warehouses! More guns for us and less for them is good for the war effort. Take what we can and..."

 nf_event_brk.7.a:0 "Send the Raiding Parties"

 nf_event_brk.8.t:0 "Campaigns of Terror"
 nf_event_brk.8.d:0 "Sending men in the night to burn villages and leave the heads of the villagers outside for all to see. That is the way of the Coast."
 nf_event_brk.8.a:0 "They will never sleep again"

 nf_event_brk.9.t:0 "[BRK.GetName] Sends Raiders"
 nf_event_brk.9.d:0 "Cloaked in their heavy coats, with weapons at the ready, raiders have entered our borders. They are looting our store houses, stealing our valuables, pillaging our industry and killing anyone who resists. The settlements on the border beg we send in militias and our armed fighting forces to fight back against the raiders - for the sake of our industry alone we should do it."
 nf_event_brk.9.a:0 "We can't afford to stop them"
 nf_event_brk.9.b:0 "Fight back!"

 nf_event_brk.10.t:0 "No Opposition from the Locals"
 nf_event_brk.10.d:0 "Our recent raids into neighboring territories have gone without a hitch. There has only been token resistance to our raiding parties from the locals, and they have managed to come back with a sizable portion of equipment, as well as some machinery and other useful items.\n\nThe territory we have raided has been left barren and bare, so we'll refrain from raiding it again anytime soon to allow the population to recover. Then we'll pillage again..."
 nf_event_brk.10.a:0 "Enjoy the spoils"

 nf_event_brk.11.t:0 "Local Opposition!"
 nf_event_brk.11.d:0 "Our raids can be a struggle - this raid is no exception. We have met marked resistance from the local populations in the form of militias and even semi-professional armed units. In the instance of this raid, just our small raiding parties won't cut the mustard. We need a larger dedication of forces to the region to crush the resistance and claim the loot that is rightfully ours."
 nf_event_brk.11.a:0 "Throw our weight behind it"

 nf_event_brk.12.t:0 "Raiders Withdraw"
 nf_event_brk.12.d:0 "The raiders from the Broken Coast have come and gone. The borderlands are in ruins - plumes of smoke dot the skyline. The attack has been truly devastating to the area, and it will take some time to recover from the attack."
 nf_event_brk.12.a:0 "Recover we must"

 nf_event_brk.13.t:0 "Border Conflict is Escalating to War"
 nf_event_brk.13.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the enemy have been inconclusive. Some ground has been won, some has been lost. A few border villages have been reduced to flaming ruins. Other than that, nothing has changed. The enemy knows this as well as we do, and appears to be taking drastic action to overcome this problem. They are mobilising for war."
 nf_event_brk.13.a:0 "Then war it shall be"

 nf_event_brk.14.t:0 "Border Conflict is Over"
 nf_event_brk.14.d:0 "Great news from the front - the border clash is over, and we have won! Enemy forces can be seen retreating before our impressive show of force, and it is time for us to at last enjoy the loot we so richly deserve."
 nf_event_brk.14.a:0 "We feast well tonight!"

 # 15.t, 16.t and 17.2 are purposefully omitted before you think I have missed them, Dominus

 nf_event_brk.15.d:0 "Great news from the front - the border clash is over, and we have won! Enemy forces can be seen retreating before our impressive show of force - we have successfully driven back the raider scum from our lands. Our people will sleep safe for a while, knowing the might of our military is there to protect them if needs be."
 nf_event_brk.15.a:0 "Good work lads"
 nf_event_brk.16.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat. The enemy has successfully repelled our raiders with their military, and so we need time to lick our wounds and regroup. We'll avoid launching raids against these settlements for some time - we'll lull them into a false sense of security, then we'll strike when the time is right."
 nf_event_brk.16.a:0 "Soon, lads. Soon."
 nf_event_brk.17.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat from the border. Raiders have overrun our border villages and settlements, destroying large swathes of land and infrastructure. Our troops have retreated to more defensible positions further back from the border, but we doubt the raiders will engage in a prolonged campaign. Instead we shall have to wait for them to retreat, lick our wounds and attempt to rebuild. We shall be more ready for them next time."
 nf_event_brk.17.a:0 "We shall rebuild..."

 nf_event_brk.18.t:0 "We Back Down"
 nf_event_brk.18.d:0 "We have tactfully decided to pull our raiders out of enemy territory to conserve manpower and equipment. We have gained valuable experience in combat through the encounter, but so have the enemy. In time we'll come back and raze their villages to the ground."
 nf_event_brk.18.a:0 "A strategic move"

 nf_event_brk.19.t:0 "Raider Back Down"
 nf_event_brk.19.d:0 "Wonderful news from the borderlands - the raiders have ceased their activities and withdrawn from our lands. Whilst it wasn't the smashing at the hands of the army we hoped for, it is certainly a victory!"
 nf_event_brk.19.a:0 "Wonderful"

 nf_event_brk.20.t:0 "Border Conflict is Escalating!"
 nf_event_brk.20.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the enemy have been inconclusive. Some ground has been won, some has been lost. A few border villages have been reduced to flaming ruins. Other than that, nothing has changed. The enemy knows this as well as we do, and appears to be taking action to overcome this sticking point. They appear to be mobilising more troops to send against our own - we must prepare to repel them too."

 nf_event_brk.21.t:0 "Raiders on our Coastlines"
 nf_event_brk.21.d:0 "Previously raids came infrequently. They used to be carried out by small groups, usually in the night. The ships landed in isolated stretches of the coastline - never our villages or our towns. All that has changed recently. Co-ordinated raid groups have attacked our villages and towns, doing unimaginable destruction before we could react. In response, militias have mobilised and are ready to defend our islands. Only time will tell how well they do..."

 nf_event_brk.40.a:0 "Graven may be cruel but he will lead us to greatness."
 nf_event_brk.40.b:0 "Ragnar is the obvious choice. His strategy and cunning will propel us to the top."
 nf_event_brk.41.t:0 "A Stirring of the North"
 nf_event_brk.41.d:0 "After our recent victory over our enemies, our informants have discovered that this time, other nations seem to have noticed. Recently a gathering of most of the major factions in the north's leadership was called upon, and from what we have gathered the topic is mutual defensive actions, and yet for some reason we were not invited... The details of the deal will be hammered out in the next 10 days, until then, we wait."
 nf_event_brk.41.a:0 "This will do nothing to save them."

 BRK_spawn_troops_resistance_tooltip:0 "§YAs a signatory of the \"Unbroken Resistance\" Act, this country will receive reinforcing militia divisions§!"
 nf_event_brk.42.t:0 "Sign the \"Unbroken Resistance\" Pact"
 nf_event_brk.42.d:0 "After the recent agressive actions by the Broken Coast, it has been suggested that the nations of the north form a pact to discourage further expansion. The plan in simply to provide small amounts of weapons production and allow volunteers as well as transportation to each member of the pact for volunteer units. These volunteer units will embed themselves in countries at risk of invasion, and upon sight of Broken Coast soldiers mobilize into a fighting force. If we sign this, the extra protection provided may be worth the effort. Simultaneously however, us being tied down to this will make diplomacy elsewhere more difficult"
 nf_event_brk.42.a:0 "Where do we sign up?"
 nf_event_brk.42.b:0 "We decline to sign."
 nf_event_brk.43.t:0 "The \"Unbroken Resistance\" Pact"
 nf_event_brk.43.d:0 "It appears that the previously discovered meetings have beared fruit. A new pact between nations of the north, dubbed the \"Unbroken Resistance\" pact, attempts to limit our expansion into neighbours. From what we can gather, this is not a formal alliance, but rather a loose defensive network. Via the great Columbia river, volunteer units from settlements across the land are being shipped in and armed, embedding into any signatory threatened by us. They can then quickly mobilize and attempt to reinforce our opponents. As our territory expands the amount of recruits they can deploy will also rise, and may become dangerous with time. We can still utilize our naval prowess to invade those outside of the pact, however, keep in mind that these distant lands are not our ultimate goal and can only serve as colonies."
