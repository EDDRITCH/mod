 nf_event_brk.1.t:0 "Our Ancestors"
 nf_event_brk.1.d:0 "The records on who the Broken Coast came from were lost to the bombs. The history of the Broken Coast has been passed down in various wise tales. Most say they come from the pre-war soldiers, but the actual truth is..."

 nf_event_brk.2.d:0 "Our ancestors joined together and formed what is now known as the Broken Coast. Their first act was to combat the Great Blizzard. Together they decided to..."
 nf_event_brk.2.a:0 "Flee the storm in hopes of returning"
 nf_event_brk.2.b:0 "Build great bunkers under the Earth"
 nf_event_brk.2.c:0 "Embrace the storm. Survival of the fitest"
 nf_event_brk.3.t:0 "Why we Fight"
 nf_event_brk.3.d:0 "Our ancestors fought and bled for the Broken Coast. The old ways are going and the new ways will lead us to glory. But we need to focus on building ourselves up. What should we focus on?"
 nf_event_brk.3.a:0 "Slaves"
 nf_event_brk.3.b:0 "Wealth"
 nf_event_brk.4.t:0 "Raids into Alvin Bleak"
 nf_event_brk.4.d:0 "We hit their warehouses! More guns for us and less for them is good for the war effort. Take what we can and..."
 nf_event_brk.4.a:0 "Burn the rest"
 nf_event_brk.5.t:0 "Breaking Whistler"
 nf_event_brk.5.d:0 "They know they are no match for us. We will make them bow to us! We will demand their surrender and annexation into the Coast."
 nf_event_brk.5.a:0 "Send the Demand"
 nf_event_brk.50.t:0 ""
 nf_event_brk.50.d:0 ""
 nf_event_brk.50.a:0 "Submit"
 nf_event_brk.50.b:0 "Refuse"

 nf_event_brk.60.d:0 ""
 nf_event_brk.60.a:0 "Submit"
 nf_event_brk.60.b:0 "Refuse"
 nf_event_brk.7.t:0 "Raiding Kamlo"
 nf_event_brk.7.d:0 "Send a few raiding parties into Kamlo to burn and loot their store houses. We'll use whatever they have against them!"
 nf_event_brk.7.a:0 "Send the Raiding Parties"
 nf_event_brk.8.t:0 "Campaigns of Terror"
 nf_event_brk.8.d:0 "Sending men in the night to burn villages and leave the heads of the villagers outside for all to see. That is the way of the Coast."
 nf_event_brk.8.a:0 "They will never sleep again"
 nf_event_brk.9.t:0 "[BRK.GetName] Sends Raiders"
 nf_event_brk.9.d:0 "Cloaked in their heavy coats, with weapons at the ready, raiders have entered our borders. They are looting our store houses, stealing our valuables, pillaging our industry and killing anyone who resists. The settlements on the border beg we send in militias and our armed fighting forces to fight back against the raiders - for the sake of our industry alone we should do it."
 nf_event_brk.9.a:0 "We can't afford to stop them"
 nf_event_brk.9.b:0 "Fight back!"
 nf_event_brk.10.t:0 "No Opposition from the Locals"
 nf_event_brk.10.d:0 "Our recent raids into neighboring territories have gone without a hitch. There has only been token resistance to our raiding parties from the locals, and they have managed to come back with a sizable portion of equipment, as well as some machinery and other useful items. \n\nThe territory we have raided has been left barren and bare, so we will refrain from raiding it again anytime soon to allow the population to recover. Then we will pillage again..."
 nf_event_brk.10.a:0 "Enjoy the spoils"
 nf_event_brk.11.t:0 "Local Opposition!"
 nf_event_brk.11.d:0 "Our raids can be a struggle - this raid is no exception. We have met marked resistance from the local populations in the form of militias and even semi-proffesional armed units. In the instance of this raid, just our small raiding parties won't cut the mustard. We need a larger dedication of forces to the region to crush the resistance and claim the loot that is rightfully ours."
 nf_event_brk.11.a:0 "Throw our weight behind it"
 nf_event_brk.12.t:0 "Raiders Withdraw"
 nf_event_brk.12.d:0 "The raiders from the Broken Coast have come and gone. The borderlands are in ruins - plumes of smoke dot the skyline. The attack has been truly devastating to the area, and it will take some time to recover from the attack."
 nf_event_brk.12.a:0 "Recover we must"
 nf_event_brk.13.t:0 "Border Conflict is Escalating to War"
 nf_event_brk.13.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the enemey have been inconclusive. Some ground has been won, some has been lost. A few border villages have been reduced to flaming ruins. Other than that, nothing has changed. The enemy knows this as well as we do, and appears to be taking drastic action to overcome this problem. They are mobalising for war."
 nf_event_brk.13.a:0 "Then war it shall be"
 nf_event_brk.14.t:0 "Border Conflict is Over"
 nf_event_brk.14.d:0 "Great news from the front - the border clash is over, and we have won! Enemy forces can be seen retreating before our impressive show of force, and it is time for us to at last enjoy the loot we so richly deserver."
 nf_event_brk.14.a:0 "We feast well tonight!"
 # 15.t, 16.t and 17.2 are purposefully ommited before you think I have missed them, Dominus
 nf_event_brk.15.d:0 "Great news from the front - the border clash is over, and we have won! Enemy forces can be seen retreating before our impressive show of force - we have succesfully driven back the raider scum from our lands. Our people will sleep safe for a while, knowing the might of our military is there to protect them if needs be."
 nf_event_brk.15.a:0 "Good work lads"
 nf_event_brk.16.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat. The enemy has succesfully repelled our raiders with their military, and so we need time to lick our wounds and regroup. We will avoid launching raids against these settlements for some time - we willlull them into a false sense of security, then we will strike when the time is right."
 nf_event_brk.16.a:0 "Soon, lads. Soon."
 nf_event_brk.17.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat from the border. Raiders have overrun our border villages and settlements, destroying large swathes of land and infastructure. Our troops have retreated to more defensible positions further back from the border, but we doubt the raiders will engage in a prolongued campaign. Instead we shall have to wait for them to retreat, lick our wounds and attempt to rebuild. We shall be more ready for them next time."
 nf_event_brk.17.a:0 "We shall rebuild..."
 nf_event_brk.18.t:0 "We Back Down"
 nf_event_brk.18.d:0 "We have tactfully decided to pull our raiders out of enemy territory to conserve manpower and equipment. We have gained valuable experience in combat through the encounter, but so have the enemy. In time we will come back and raze their villages to the ground."
 nf_event_brk.18.a:0 "A strategic move"
 nf_event_brk.19.t:0 "Raider Back Down"
 nf_event_brk.19.d:0 "Wonderful news from the borderlands - the raiders have ceased their activites and withdrawn from our lands. Whilst it wasn't the smashing at the hands of the army we hoped for, it is certainly a victory!"
 nf_event_brk.19.a:0 "Wonderful"
 nf_event_brk.20.t:0 "Border Conflict is Escalating!"
 nf_event_brk.20.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the enemey have been inconclusive. Some ground has been won, some has been lost. A few border villages have been reduced to flaming ruins. Other than that, nothing has changed. The enemy knows this as well as we do, and appears to be taking action to overcome this sticking point. They appear to be mobalising more troops to send against our own - we must prepare to repell them too."
 nf_event_brk.21.t:0 "Raiders on our Coastlines"
 nf_event_brk.21.d:0 "Previously raids came infrequently. They used to be carried out by small groups, usually in the night. The ships landed in isolated stretches of the coastline - never our villages or our towns. All that has changed recently. Co-ordinated raid groups have attacked our villages and towns, doing unimaginable distruction before we could react. In response, militias have mobalised and are ready to defend our islands. Only time will tell how well they do..."
 nf_event_brk.21.a:0 "Resist!"
 nf_event_brk.22.t:0 "Successful Raid against the [HAI.GetName]"
 nf_event_brk.40.t:0 "The Moot"
 nf_event_brk.40.d:0 "Graven has pushed the people too far. This Moot will decide the future of the Coast. Ragnar has the support of the people but Graven still has a lot of support with the elite within the Coast. Who will prevail?"
 nf_event_brk.40.a:0 "Graven may be cruel but he will lead us to greatness."
 nf_event_brk.40.b:0 "Ragnar is the obvious choice. His strategy and cunning will propel us to the top."
