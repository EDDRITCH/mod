 hea_nf_precursers:0 "Legacy of Scripture"
 hea_nf_precursers_desc:0 "The word of God has always been the supreme law of the land, even in times where Heaven's Gate has been lead by more moderate leaders. These divine writings have always inspired our people, generation after generation."

 hea_nf_pilgrims:0 "Pilgrims Cometh"
 hea_nf_pilgrims_desc:0 "Pilgrims have traveled to our lands, whether intentionally or unintentionally, for the better part of several decades. For these people, churches and shrines have been built, yet one has always been more popular than the other!"

 hea_nf_tribals:0 "Pagan Conversion"
 hea_nf_tribals_desc:0 "Tribals have come to join our flock time and time again, sometimes individuals, sometimes entire tribes. Their arrival can never be predicted, and often strain our resources."

 hea_nf_innocence_lost:0 "Innocence Lost"
 hea_nf_innocence_lost_desc:0 "The Tragedy at Innocence Lost can never be understated. The rage of the Pagan fell upon the peaceful pilgrim, and it is said that the blood spilt there stains the ground red to this day. A word of warning to all faithful."

 hea_nf_pol_action:0 "The Great Debate"
 hea_nf_pol_action_desc:0 "The legacy of the Great Debate is ancient, dating back to the years following the great war, wherein the people feared violence might break out between the people of differing faiths. Instead, on each sunday, all who have faith in God are encouraged to do intellectual and theological battle with one another, where all can see."

 hea_nf_embrace_elite:0 "Victory to the Clergy"
 hea_nf_embrace_elite_desc:0 "The Clergy quite nearly lost the hearts and minds of the people to the sheer charisma and audacity of the young Prophet, yet it can be said that cooler heads inevitably triumphed. For even the Prophet cannot debate a small army of wizened minds, every Sunday. Inevitably, even he sees the wisdom in their words."

 hea_nf_embrace_elite_1:0 "Council of Christ"
 hea_nf_embrace_elite_1_desc:0 "Now Christened the Council of Christ, the elders of the city, joined by the prophet, move forward with their usual plans and agenda. They seek to unify the all people under God, and focus heavily on bringing more lost souls to mass."

 hea_nf_reject_elite:0 "The Prophet Prevails"
 hea_nf_reject_elite_desc:0 "The Words of the prophet have quite literally been written on the subway walls, down below the city. In households, dining halls, and sacred places, his words are spoken. The Great Debate has become less a debate, and more a rallying call to all who wish to see him cast down the Old Elite, through wit, word, and sheer willpower."

 hea_nf_reject_elite_1:0 "The Archangel Rises"
 hea_nf_reject_elite_1_desc:0 "All who would stand against the will of the Prophet have been subdued, and those who remain kneel in his presence. Divinity walks among us, and with him comes the word of God. There are none who can consider the Theocratic Elite anything but pretenders in his presence, for surely, this man has God on his side."

 hea_nf_consolidate_pol:0 "Religious Evolution"
 hea_nf_consolidate_pol_desc:0 "A time of change is upon us, and the people flock to Heaven’s Gate! They drop to their knees in our churches, and whisper eager prayers to our lord, asking forgiveness and mercy. The world is changing, and at last? Religion changes with it."

 hea_nf_grand_cathedral:0 "The Billowing Cathedral"
 hea_nf_grand_cathedral_desc:0 "In the very heart of the Heaven’s Gate there has always been a massive, ruined cathedral, a relic of the old world that survived where all other things crumbled to ruin and dust. The renovation of this cathedral has been the work of a thousand men, over several decades. Choir call all within the city to mass, and the smoke calls all within a hundred miles to the city."

 hea_nf_innocence_lost_deal:0 "Memories of Innocence"
 hea_nf_innocence_lost_deal_desc:0 "Innocence was, true to its namesake, a peaceful town of kind souls, doing what they could to survive in the wasteland. For their faith and kindness, they were butchered by uncertain and fearful Pagan masses. There are few alive today who do not still weep for a lost loved one, taken back by misery and uncertainty. In time, what will this fear become?"

 hea_nf_forgive_sins:0 "Learning to Forgive"
 hea_nf_forgive_sins_desc:0 "Hatred is not the way of God, nor is it intrinsic to the heart of mankind. The world has bled enough, suffered enough because men and women could not let go. We have been given a second chance in what remains of our lord’s greatest creation, so let us not taint this with the same spite that ruined it."

 hea_nf_fog_of_mercy:0 "Mercy for the Wicked"
 hea_nf_fog_of_mercy_desc:0 "Those Pagans who once butched Innocence fled from us for decades, fearing what would happen when we caught them, fearing the wrath of our God. Yet when we found them? We offered mercy to all who would take it, and word of that mercy spread like wildfire through the land. In the eyes of all who look upon us, we are remembered for this kindness."

 hea_nf_vengance:0 "An Eye for an Eye"
 hea_nf_vengance_desc:0 "And have we forgotten the Plagues? The walls of Jericho? The drowned armies of the Pharaoh? Mercy goes to those who deserve it, and we can never forgive them for what they have done. Let it be known to all who remember Innocence, and to all who hear of it. The wicked will suffer the vengeance of the faithful."

 hea_nf_boilers_of_justice:0 "Boiled Alive"
 hea_nf_boilers_of_justice_desc:0 "Those Pagans once butchered Innocence fled for as far as their legs could take them, scattered to the wind and in a hundred directions. Once every few months, such a man or woman is caught and dragged back to Heaven’s Gate, where they are forgiven, but after being punished for their sin. Baptised in boiling water, so that they might travel to heaven and beg the forgiveness of those they struck down."

 hea_nf_addres_militarism:0 "A Culture of War?"
 hea_nf_addres_militarism_desc:0 "Long ago, Heaven’s Gate was a largely peaceful community nestled high in the mountains. Warriors were few, for our threats were few. Yet times change, and smoke rises from manufactories and weapons shops, young men march in lockstep, preparing for wars they believe will come. The loss of Innocence has changed the very way we look at the world, and how we react to it shall forever shape our nation."

 hea_nf_embrace_militarism:0 "Embracing Violence"
 hea_nf_embrace_militarism_desc:0 "And what good has mercy given the faithful? If we can not defend our people, what good is our faith? What good are our dreams? We must learn to protect ourselves to prevent yet another tragedy. The arms of the faithful are filled with the strength of man and God."

 hea_nf_embrace_militarism_1:0 "Declaration of Crusade"
 hea_nf_embrace_militarism_1_desc:0 "The Crusades are a thing of legend, for so little is known of them. It is said that an army of the faithful rose up to cast down false prophets, to march forth and defend against the heathen masses. Man and woman, grandfather and grandson, all answer the call, and all prepare for the war against the enemies of God."

 hea_nf_fight_militarism:0 "The Rise of Mercy"
 hea_nf_fight_militarism_desc:0 "And what good are we if we become our enemies? If we give way to madness and violence? War is not who we are, nor will it ever be who we are. A bastion for good, a bastion for change. Heaven’s Gate shall be the heart of God’s kingdom on earth, and no Kingdom of God shall go forth to butched those who know no better."

 hea_nf_fight_militarism_1:0 "Declaration of Sanctuary"
 hea_nf_fight_militarism_1_desc:0 "All who are lost may come to the Gate. Those fleeing persecution, those fleeing slavery, those fleeing their conquerors. All of whom and are willing to believe may find Sanctuary within our walls, and in time? Our home shall become their home, our food shall become their food, and our faith shall become their faith."
