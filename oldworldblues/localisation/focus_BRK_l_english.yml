 brk_nf_our_fathers:0 "Our Ancestors"
 brk_nf_our_fathers_desc:0 "British Columbia was filled with all sorts before the Great War, and its survivors were no less complex. Indeed, the pirates of the broken coast have all sorts of ancestories, but none of them are better off for it. They all stare down at the bottom of half empty beer flasks and wish for better days. Eventually, they all throw their caps on the countertop, grab their weapon, and head back into the Endless White."
 brk_nf_our_goals:0 "The Great Blizzard"
 brk_nf_our_goals_desc:0 "\"Back in Redbeard's day, there was a blizzard so fierce none but he dared sail in its winds. It clouded the sky for years, it stacked the coast with more snow than ever before or since, and it killed thousands. They say the wind howled with the fury of the dead. But Redbeard, that crazy bastard, never once got so much as frostbite.\" - Welt, former pirate captain, and owner of the Cap and Cash bar in Koover."
 brk_nf_our_gods:0 "Why we Fight"
 brk_nf_our_gods_desc:0 "Money has always ruled the Broken Coast. Much like how the waves dash against its jagged rocks with fury, so too are many hopes and dreams dashed by pirates simply looking for their next paycheck. Do the people of the Broken Coast enjoy the endless conflict their way of life provides? Maybe, but perhaps if they were offered an alternative, they might consider it. Afterall: everyone wants to retire eventually."
 brk_nf_grand_moot:0 "The Moot"
 brk_nf_grand_moot_desc:0 "Graven the Cruel recieved his title for a reason. Even by the standards of a nation of raider pirates, his methods are particularly sadistic and cruel. His right hand man, Ragnar, is much more moderate, and in line with the former leaders of the Coast. A Moot has been called to summon together the Coast and challenge Graven's authority: it will decide the future of our nation. Bets are already being placed."
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade:0 "Educated Pirates?"
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_desc:0 "A wise man once said: \"Give me a lever large enough and I will uproot the sun for you.\" Today, this wise man is little more than broken charred bones—but he spoke true when he was flesh and blood. If we want to uproot the wasteland from it's pitiful state, and therefore expand the Coast, we need a very large lever: technology."
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_1:0 "Educated Pirates"
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_1_desc:0 "After much study, we finally have the lever to uproot the north, perhaps even the entire wasteland. For much of our history, the Powder Monkies were mocked for the way they developed and relied on technology, but now we understand the error in our ways. Technology is the future, it will let us achieve whatever we set out minds on!"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol:0 "Graven the Cruel"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_desc:0 "Stories of Graven's adventures as a young man are savage, and chilling. His rise to power became increasingly bloodier, and his ascent to the head of the Coast was punctuated by the slaughter of the innocent. The betrayer's moot has invited rage into his heart, consuming what little remained of his humanity. Nothing will hold him back now. §RGraven's fury will echo across the wasteland forever!§!"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_1:0 "Solidify Authority"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_1_desc:0 "Blood. Blood was the only word you could use to describe the week after the Moot. Graven, truly unhinged by what he saw as the gravest betrayal, personally took to the streets and seas to hunt down almost every man and woman who voted against him. His hunt continues, but the damage is already done. Never again will the people of the Coast question Graven's authority over them—for fear of his wrath."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_2:0 "Enslave the Opposition"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_2_desc:0 "Graven returned to Koover at the helm of a ship adorned with the decapitated heads of his lesser enemies. Ragnar kneeled there on the frozen dock, put in shackles weeks before by Graven himself, to witness the return of everyone he loved: §Rcoming back to port as rotting trophies.§! Ragnar is a broken man, a trophy commander for Graven, a fierce reminder that not even the strongest can oppose him."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side:0 "Graven´s Grand Palace"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_desc:0 "Formerly known as the Vancouver Town Hall, the towering concrete structure that once held meetings on public spending now hosts bloody contests of strength, drug fuelled sex, and an army of the loyalist men Graven's regime has to offer. To stand within his palace and gaze upon his statue of himself is an honour, or so he says. The walls are filled with eyes, and once a man steps out of line: he never leaves."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_1:0 "Graven´s Palace Ship"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_1_desc:0 "Graven, still consumed by rage and paranoia from his betrayal at the Moot, has designed a ship fit for a conqueror such as himself. It has every accomodation possible, making it a floating pleasure palace, but unlike most jet dens it also has enough firepower to level anything it might encounter. Graven demands his magnum opus be constructed, and his men can do little but obey."
 brk_nf_wife_of_conquest:0 "Trophy Wife"
 brk_nf_wife_of_conquest_desc:0 "The \"Collared Queen\" sits atop her throne alone, broken, and devoid of life. Once the shining beauty of her proud island nation, Queen Victoria is little more than a doll for Graven's sadistic perversions now, having captured her himself during the siege of New Victoria. Although she isn't tortured and mutilated like most of his other captives, her suffering is clear to any who look into her dead, empty eyes."
 brk_nf_wife_of_strength:0 "Martial Contest"
 brk_nf_wife_of_strength_desc:0 "Graven has two uses for a woman; either as a plaything, or as a tool. Clearly he has decided he desires a tool, declaring a gladiatorial contest for the reward of a place at his side. The sane would never participate, but the sane do not desire absolute power. Already, many a demented raider woman has signed up in the hope of taming the cruellest man in the north."
 brk_nf_elites_pol:0 "Ragnar"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_desc:0 "Though Ragnar won the vote at the Moot, Graven holds onto whatever power he still has left. Ragnar must build up his own powerbase if he has any hope of winning against Graven. He will not give up his power easily and will fight to the last man."
 brk_nf_elites_pol_1:0 "The Duel"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_1_desc:0 "Ragnar has challenged Graven to a duel in a brilliant move against his enemy. Traditionally, only the strongest would lead the Broken Coast. If Graven declines the duel, even his loyalists will turn against him. It is said that for his tough exterior, Graven isn’t much of a fighter."
 brk_nf_elites_pol_2:0 "Form the Broken Coast Warrior Council"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_2_desc:0 "Even though Ragnar won the duel, the elites tried to put some weak fool in charge of the Coast in one final act of defiance. He knows that in order to take true control, he must establish his own power base as the primary council within the Coast. With one swift act, the newly christened Warrior Council slaughtered the puppet leader and the puppet masters."
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side:0 "Establish Port Royal"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_desc:0 "The ancient Port Royal was a strong symbol to pirates of the day. It’s time we give our own people such a symbol! The Broken Coast will field the largest navy ever known to the wasteland and this port will house it. "
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_1:0 "Black Flag Fleet"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_1_desc:0 "Ragnar has decreed that extra ships be built for use in his new fleet. A terrifying visage is present on all the figureheads. A dark and twisted look for the newly christened Black Flag Fleet. A fleet that will terrorise the wastes for years to come."
 brk_nf_warrior_priests:0 "Offense Council"
 brk_nf_warrior_priests_desc:0 "The council formed to restore order was a success. Now it is time for the council to evolve into the warrior council it was meant to be! Blood for blood, the council will ensure that we don’t run dry of it for many, many years."
 brk_nf_home_priests:0 "Defense Council"
 brk_nf_home_priests_desc:0 "The council formed to restore order was a success. Now it is time for the council to evolve into the warrior council it was meant to be! Safety and stability should be our focus in the Coast. The council will guard against those unworthy at home."
 brk_nf_til_strid:0 "War of the Coast"
 brk_nf_til_strid_desc:0 "Our ancestors spoke of a time that we would control all of the north. It’s time to let the people know that our time has come. No longer are we to remain simple raiders. We will push our enemies from our shores. For the Coast!"
 brk_nf_frozen_shores:0 "The Frozen Cabal"
 brk_nf_frozen_shores_desc:0 "The Frozen Cabal has been the leading organization within the Coast for decades. They pick where we raid and what slaves we take. The Cabal is powerful and we need to use them to keep the people in line while we expand. Even pirates need to be strong armed sometimes."
 brk_nf_raid_whistler:0 "Raids into Alvin Bleak"
 brk_nf_raid_whistler_desc:0 "Whistler has always been a big target for our raids, but nothing will compare to what Hell we are about to unleash upon Whistler. Their women and children will weep as their homes burn around them and their husbands are slaughtered in the snow. We must show them true terror."
 brk_nf_demand_whistler:0 "Whistler Will Bow"
 brk_nf_demand_whistler_desc:0 "Our raids of terror have driven hate and fear into the heart of the Whistler people. Driven back into their forests, the cowards are practically begging us to rule them. So why disappoint them? The pirate life will spread to all."
 brk_nf_integrate_enemies:0 "Breaking their Will"
 brk_nf_integrate_enemies_desc:0 "Now that Whistler and Kamlo have been integrated into the Coast, it's time to break the will of their people. They will fear us. They will bow to us."

 brk_nf_protect_whistler_desc:0 "Whistler must pay for our protection. But we don't need money. We'll protect them for their annexation."
 brk_nf_aid_whistler:0 "Whistler Compromise"
 brk_nf_aid_whistler_desc:0 "Whistler knows they cannot beat us in a war. Since we have shown our support they will accept a compromise to be integrated into the Broken Coast. It's a new era for the Broken Coast."
 brk_nf_raid_kamlo:0 "Kamlo Raiding Parties"
 brk_nf_raid_kamlo_desc:0 "We need more weapons to fuel the war. Kamlo looks like a good target..."
 brk_nf_break_kamlo:0 "Night of Horror"
 brk_nf_break_kamlo_desc:0 "Showing Kamlo our strength is not enough. We must break their will completely. We must use the most savage techniques we know."
 brk_nf_enslave_kamlo:0 "Breaking Kamlo"
