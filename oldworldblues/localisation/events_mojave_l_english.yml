 nf_mojave.2.desc:0 "Common knowledge dictates that the elders of any given society hold the largest wealth of knowledge, and that was truest within the Brotherhood of Steel. Father Elijah had learned a great many things as his life ticked away year after year, and as his youth left him it was replaced with a ravenous desire to reach the unreachable. He had an incurable and deadly disease that had sent many a fool to an early death: Old World Blues. But unlike his peers, Elijah possessed the skills to make his obsession a reality.Two places captivated him with their alluring glow of the bygone era of mankind. Helios One and the Sierra Madre. The former was in his new backyard, within throwing distance of the headquarters of his newly established chapter. Abandoned and unattended for an unknowable amount of time, the seemingly benign solar power plant held a dark secret. Elijah had a hunch that there was more to this place than power generation, and he was determined to lay its secrets bare.His second obsession was a much deeper, more insidious love. He'd heard tales of a forlorn desert jewel: the Sierra Madre. It was a place said to contain riches beyond your imagination, where any wish could be granted. Whether or not he believed these prospector's tales, he knew that the casino and resort was using rare prototype technology. It had its dangers, he was sure, but if he could find it he would crack it open as simply as any safe. As far as Elijah was concerned, nothing was sacred: everything was his to know."
