 nf_mojave.2.desc:0 "Common knowledge dictates that the elders of any given society hold the largest wealth of knowledge, and that was truest within the Brotherhood of Steel. Father Elijah had learned a great many things as his life ticked away year after year, and as his youth left him it was replaced with a ravenous desire to reach the unreachable. He had an incurable and deadly disease that had sent many a fool to an early death: Old World Blues. But unlike his peers, Elijah possessed the skills to make his obsession a reality.Two places captivated him with their alluring glow of the bygone era of mankind. Helios One and the Sierra Madre. The former was in his new backyard, within throwing distance of the headquarters of his newly established chapter. Abandoned and unattended for an unknowable amount of time, the seemingly benign solar power plant held a dark secret. Elijah had a hunch that there was more to this place than power generation, and he was determined to lay its secrets bare.His second obsession was a much deeper, more insidious love. He'd heard tales of a forlorn desert jewel: the Sierra Madre. It was a place said to contain riches beyond your imagination, where any wish could be granted. Whether or not he believed these prospector's tales, he knew that the casino and resort was using rare prototype technology. It had its dangers, he was sure, but if he could find it he would crack it open as simply as any safe. As far as Elijah was concerned, nothing was sacred: everything was his to know."

Messages like these can be found scribbled across the Mojave, left by fools young and old alike chasing a fleeting dream. If you don't find a poster, you find a postcard. If it's not a postcard then it's the broadcast - anything can pull you in, but once you hear that voice you're hooked. Elijah was the same as anybody else, once he found out about that old world jewel he was in love. That ravenous desire rooted deep inside of himself was enraptured by the Sierra Madre.He prepared an expedition force to travel with him to the Sierra Madre, ten members of the Brotherhood would journy with him there. They would set out in order to scour the ruins for technology. It was no secret that many a prospector had died exploring the Sierra Madre for salvage, and those who survived spun tales of a city akin to El Dorado. Rumours of mysterious technology unseen anywhere else drove Elijah forward, one step at a time.''There's treasures there, sleeping,'' he told his group as their journey began. ''Some, awake.''"

 mojave_helios_one_news.0.desc:0 "Howdy folks, Mr. New Vegas here letting you know it's an absolutely scorching 109 degrees Fahrenheit out there today. Grab yourself a bottle of sarsaparilla and stay hydrated. You deserve a treat. Now, onto the news. NCR patrols to Helios One were met with gunfire this afternoon, confirming the fears of NCR officials at Camp McCarren. ''Early this morning the troopers stationed at the power facility were attacked,'' an anonymous NCR officer told RNV. Reports from Novac support this, as many residents supposedly awoke to the sound of a large firefight. All reports end with a similar statement: right before the battle ended a large pillar of light turned the sky white. Onlookers described it as some kind of giant laser, and the smell of charred flesh that lingered afterwards, as well as the ash left around the facility seem to confirm this. The NCR is yet to release an official statement. That was today's news,  now I'd like to play one of our classics for you all."

It's news time, ladies and gentlemen. Today the NCR released a statement confirming that they'd taken control of Helios One. This was released earlier today, a day after the fighting subsidied. The battle lasted most of yesterday, and saw at least two thousand NCR troops gathered to fight against the Brotherhood forces. Our sources claim the NCR has been preparing this operation for a while, and it seems to have been a success, although both sides suffered heavy losses. The question is now whether such loss of life was worth it. That news was brought to you by The Tops casino. You'll dig us, baby, we're the tops."
