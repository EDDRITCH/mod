 nf_mojave.2.desc:0 "Common knowledge dictates that the elders of any given society hold the largest wealth of knowledge, and that was truest within the Brotherhood of Steel. Father Elijah had learned a great many things as his life ticked away year after year, and as his youth left him it was replaced with a ravenous desire to reach the unreachable. He had an incurable and deadly disease that had sent many a fool to an early death: Old World Blues. But unlike his peers, Elijah possessed the skills to make his obsession a reality.Two places captivated him with their alluring glow of the bygone era of mankind. Helios One and the Sierra Madre. The former was in his new backyard, within throwing distance of the headquarters of his newly established chapter. Abandoned and unattended for an unknowable amount of time, the seemingly benign solar power plant held a dark secret. Elijah had a hunch that there was more to this place than power generation, and he was determined to lay its secrets bare.His second obsession was a much deeper, more insidious love. He'd heard tales of a forlorn desert jewel: the Sierra Madre. It was a place said to contain riches beyond your imagination, where any wish could be granted. Whether or not he believed these prospector's tales, he knew that the casino and resort was using rare prototype technology. It had its dangers, he was sure, but if he could find it he would crack it open as simply as any safe. As far as Elijah was concerned, nothing was sacred: everything was his to know."

 nf_mojave.3.desc:0 "Blood pooled under a red sun as the sound of creaking metal echoed throughout the villa like a distorted scream. One of the knights looked down at his chest, only to see a ghastly arm protruding from it, wriggling around in the air as if it were trying to grasp more flesh. Twitching violently, it pulled back with supernatural force, and the knight fell to the ground as he vomited blood inside his own helmet. Elijah was forced to watch in horror, him and his surviving followers faced by a creature unlike any other.It stood there, hunched over its kill with arms wide and reaching for the dead man. Suddenly, it twitched in place, letting out a terrible screach and chitter as it turned to face the group. Clad from head to toe in some kind of hazmat suit, its face was nothing more than a gas mask. Its visors glowed a deep green, like haunted jade, and its green breath streamed out of the filter in waves like smoke. The Sierra Madre was not a forgotten dream, or a paradise waiting to be discovered: it was Hell on Earth."

 nf_mojave.4.t:0 "Close Down Van Graffs"
 nf_mojave.4.desc:0 "Brotherhood scouts had reported that a group was establishing itself in the Mojave as a distributor of Pre-War weapons. Upon further investigation they turned out to be part of the Van Graff family. Lowlifes like the Van Graffs didn't phase Hardin in the slightest. Their family was a massive organised crime syndicate operating out of Redding in the NCR, and was partly responsible for the NCR's weak expansion north. In Hardin's eyes, it was time they reminded the Mojave that the Brotherhood was still a force to be reckoned with. Their guard stationed outside proved easy enough to deal with. The Brotherhood didn't need to worry about stealth, the moment they turned the corner and saw him standing there, they simply opened fire. Moments later, the pile of ash and bloody body parts didn't stop them from kicking down the door. As the traders reached for their weapons, the Brotherhood poured into the building as a few of them stood at the sides and fired at the remaining guards.Charging forwards into the building with his men, Hardin launched himself at a guard reaching for a plasma pistol, tackling him into the wall with a loud crack. A few minutes later and the Silver Rush was silent save for the sound of servos moving. Hardin's men began to strip the shop of its valuables, taking everything they could get their hands on. Energy weapons, ammo, armour, salvage: all of it was theirs. A crowd that had formed outside the casino dispersed when the Brotherhood began to leave, with a few of the Kings trailing them until they left Freeside for good. Everybody felt it: the Brotherhood were back."

 nf_mojave.16.desc:0 "Standing inside the vault at the heart of that facility, Elijah reflected on everything he'd learned in this place. Of the ten people he'd brought with him, only four remained at his side, but it hadn't been for nothing. The story of the Sierra Madre was a story of ravenous love, jealousy, and ultimately betrayal. How ironic that the woman he'd so desperately wanted to save died in her room? None of it mattered anymore, though. It was a drama 200 years in the making, the pages of its chapters long since written. What interested Elijah more was this vault, its contents, and the contents of the streets above.In time, he would take everything from this place for himself, but he had to prioritise something to start with. The most appealing of the Sierra Madre's miracle technologies were its holograms and its vending machines. The holograms were incredible, almost entirely invulnerable soldiers capable of killing any sort of intruder. One hologram in the right place could become a one man army. On the other hand, the vending machines were a similarly incredible technology. They were capable of creating anything they were programmed to create. They made everything molecularly, fabricating anything the user desired, in return for some useless currency. Seeing as Elijah had already discovered a way to trick the machines, their potential applications seemed limitless."

 nf_mojave.17.desc:0 "Although the Van Graffs had been dealt with, there was another, more serious distributor of Pre-War weaponry in the Mojave—the Gun Runners. Established in the Boneyard, within the NCR's border, the manufacturer had expanded to many areas across the wasteland. The NCR is one of their biggest customers, although they only buy quality goods from them for a select number of soldiers. Their weapons are designed from pre-war schematics, making them not only quality, but also incredibly valuable to the Brotherhood.Hardin ordered assaults on their supply caravans travelling through the Mojave, in the hope of crippling the local NCR rangers, making life difficult for the Gun Runners, and gaining high quality weapons for the Brotherhood. As the raids progressed, however, the NCR began sending guards along with the caravans to deter the Brotherhood. Eventually, assaulting each caravan became like assaulting an NCR outpost. The Brotherhood couldn't continue like this. Switching their tactics, Hardin decided a much more drastic course of action was preferable. Amassing his forces for an assault on the Gun Runners' local production facility, the Brotherhood stormed the building and killed everyone inside. Looting any schematics they could find to keep them out of the Gun Runners' hands, they stripped the place clean before leaving. "

Messages like these can be found scribbled across the Mojave, left by fools young and old alike chasing a fleeting dream. If you don't find a poster, you find a postcard. If it's not a postcard then it's the broadcast - anything can pull you in, but once you hear that voice you're hooked. Elijah was the same as anybody else, once he found out about that old world jewel he was in love. That ravenous desire rooted deep inside of himself was enraptured by the Sierra Madre.He prepared an expedition force to travel with him to the Sierra Madre, ten members of the Brotherhood would journy with him there. They would set out in order to scour the ruins for technology. It was no secret that many a prospector had died exploring the Sierra Madre for salvage, and those who survived spun tales of a city akin to El Dorado. Rumours of mysterious technology unseen anywhere else drove Elijah forward, one step at a time.''There's treasures there, sleeping,'' he told his group as their journey began. ''Some, awake.''"

 mojave_helios_one_news.0.desc:0 "Howdy folks, Mr. New Vegas here letting you know it's an absolutely scorching 109 degrees Fahrenheit out there today. Grab yourself a bottle of sarsaparilla and stay hydrated. You deserve a treat. Now, onto the news. NCR patrols to Helios One were met with gunfire this afternoon, confirming the fears of NCR officials at Camp McCarren. ''Early this morning the troopers stationed at the power facility were attacked,'' an anonymous NCR officer told RNV. Reports from Novac support this, as many residents supposedly awoke to the sound of a large firefight. All reports end with a similar statement: right before the battle ended a large pillar of light turned the sky white. Onlookers described it as some kind of giant laser, and the smell of charred flesh that lingered afterwards, as well as the ash left around the facility seem to confirm this. The NCR is yet to release an official statement. That was today's news,  now I'd like to play one of our classics for you all."

It's news time, ladies and gentlemen. Today the NCR released a statement confirming that they'd taken control of Helios One. This was released earlier today, a day after the fighting subsidied. The battle lasted most of yesterday, and saw at least two thousand NCR troops gathered to fight against the Brotherhood forces. Our sources claim the NCR has been preparing this operation for a while, and it seems to have been a success, although both sides suffered heavy losses. The question is now whether such loss of life was worth it. That news was brought to you by The Tops casino. You'll dig us, baby, we're the tops."
