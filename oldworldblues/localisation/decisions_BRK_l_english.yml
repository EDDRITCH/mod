 brk_light_border_raid_defender_warning_desc:0 "Raiders have been crossing into our borders with the Broken Coast. Their raiding parties are pillaging our villages and looting our stores. Soon the raids will come to a head - either with their withdrawal (carrying our loot with them), or a clash between our forces and theirs."

 brk_vic_practice_raid:0 "The Practice Raid"
 brk_vic_practice_raid_desc:0 "Raiding is simple - you point a gun at some defenceless person and make them hand over their valuables. Raiding over water against a hostile nation? That's not quite as easy. Fortunately we have a small, relatively weak nation in the former of the [HAI.GetName] just off our coast - let us practice our raiding arts on them to give us a better shot in our raids against [VIC.GetNameDef]"
 brk_vic_raid_the_coasts:0 "Raid the Coasts"
 brk_vic_raid_the_coasts_desc:0 "The people of [VIC.GetNameDef] have lived in relative safety compared to those in the borderlands. They do not fear our flag, nor the sight of our boats.

 brk_vic_seize_winter_harbour_desc:0 "The Winter Harbour is far from Victoria city, isolated and rich. It sits ripe for the taking by a coordinated invasion, but the question is - how should we do it? There are three plans..."

 brk_vic_terror_desc:0 "The people of the coasts and the ports fear our boats, but now all the people of New Victoria must fear our flag. Only once the fear is firmly rooted in their hearts will they be ours."
