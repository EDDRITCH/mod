 nf_event_brk.9.d:0 "Cloaked in their heavy coats, with weapons at the ready, raiders have entered our borders. They are looting our store houses, stealing our valuables, pillaging our industry and killing anyone who resists. The settlements on the border beg we send in militias and our armed fighting forces to fight back against the raiders - for the sake of our industry alone we should do it."

 nf_event_brk.11.d:0 "Our raids can be a struggle - this raid is no exception. We have met marked resistance from the local populations in the form of militias and even semi-proffesional armed units.

 nf_event_brk.13.d:0 "Our recent clashes with the enemey have been inconclusive. Some ground has been won, some has been lost. A few border villages have been reduced to flaming ruins.

 nf_event_brk.16.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat. The enemy has succesfully repelled our raiders with their military, and so we need time to lick our wounds and regroup.

 nf_event_brk.16.a:0 "Soon, lads. Soon."
 nf_event_brk.17.d:0 "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat from the border. Raiders have overrun our border villages and settlements, destroying large swathes of land and infastructure. Our troops have retreated to more defensible positions further back from the border, but we doubt the raiders will engage in a prolongued campaign.

 brk_light_border_raid_defender_warning_desc:0 "Raiders have been crossing into our borders with the Broken Coast. Their raiding parties are pillaging our villages and looting our stores. Soon the raids will come to a head - either with their withdrawl (carrying our loot with them), or a clash between our forces and theirs."

 brk_raiding_vic_desc:0 "The lights of New Victoria dazzle across the water, whispering of fortune and fame. The time has come for us to grasp the fortunes and fame for ourselves - it is time to raid [VIC.GetNameDef]."
 brk_vic_practice_raid:0 "The Practice Raid"
 brk_vic_practice_raid_desc:0 "Raiding is simple - you point a gun at some defenceless person and make them hand over their valuables. Raiding over water against a hostile nation? That's not quite as easy. Fortunately we have a small, relatively weak nation in the former of the [HAI.GetName] just off our coast - let us practice our raiding arts on them to give us a better shot in our raids against [VIC.GetNameDef]"
 brk_vic_raid_the_coasts:0 "Raid the Coasts"
 brk_vic_raid_the_coasts_desc:0 "The people of [VIC.GetNameDef] have lived in relative saftey compared to those in the borderlands. They do not fear our flag, nor the sight of our boats. We must teach them to fear us before we can lord over them. The coastlines are vast - far too vast for any army [VIC.GetNameDef] might have to effectively protect. This makes them the perfect starting place for our campaign of terror."
 brk_vic_raid_the_ports:0 "Raid the Ports"
 brk_vic_raid_the_ports_desc:0 "Now that we have terrorised the coastlines, it is time to intensify our campaign against the more defensible areas - the ports and the towns. It will be harder to pull off a good raid here, because of a higher military presence."
 brk_vic_seize_winter_harbour:0 "Seize the Winter Harbour"
 brk_vic_seize_winter_harbour_desc:0 "The Winter Harbour is far from Victoria city, isolated and rich. It sits ripe for the taking by a coordinated invasion, but the question is - how should we do it? There are three plans..."
 brk_vic_wartime:0 "War for Victoria"
 brk_vic_wartime_desc:0 "Previously the prospect of looting the great city of Victoria seemed like a dream. Now the dream is close to reality. It is time for war."
