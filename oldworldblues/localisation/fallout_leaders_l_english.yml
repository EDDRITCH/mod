  Mr_Bishop_DESC:0 "Soon after the Enclave's defeat at Navarro, a new Bishop child was born.

However, other mob families still threaten his rule."
  Jeremiah_DESC:0 "When Jeremiah Rigdon passed into adulthood, he fell into a great fever, where he began speaking in tongues. After his recovery, he claimed that God had spoken to him, and decreed him the Living Prophet. He regularly suffers from fits where he hears spirits and the word of God."
  IMMORTAL_DESC:0 "Revered by his subordinates for leading them across the midwest to Seattle, the so called 'Immortal' Elder is older than even his most senior commanders. His campaign of violence and subjugation throughout Washington has inspired a lust for blood in his chapter - leaving a black stain on the Brotherhood as a whole."
  CHOSEN_DESC:0 "Legendary among their people for accomplishing the task of finding a G.E.C.K., saving them from the Enclave, and reuniting the two bloodlines - the Chosen One is worthy of being called a hero. New Arroyo thrives under their leadership, having become a powerful and peaceful nation."

  MICHAEL_DESC:0 "Baptised in the water that powers the mighty steam engines of Heaven's Gate, Saint Michael would go from a humble settler to a man who spoke to God.

Unfortunately for the wasteland, Michael considers everyone a sinner."
  OLDDOG_DESC:0 "The so called "king" of the Whithered Dogs, Old Dog is a ghoul gone almost completely feral. Having survived the Great War, he like many other ghouls was driven out of Dog City by the Hangdogs out of fear, and left to find a home in the north. His instability has made his rule temperamental and dangerous, but for many ghouls his rule is preferable to segregation and oppression."
  Graven_DESC:0 "Graven is a dispicable leader. Often Called Graven the Cruel, he leads his people with an iron fist. He strongly believes he deserves to be ruler of all the west coast and is very self centered. While he boasts of his care for the people, the only person he cares about is himself."
  Ragnar_DESC:0 "Ragnar is Graven's second. He is his best general and is very loved by the people. Many people would like to see him in power rather than Graven."
