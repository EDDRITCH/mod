 WBH_our_founding:0 "Our Founding"
 WBH_our_founding_desc:0 "While High Elder Maxson was the founder of the Brotherhood as a whole, each chapter has had its own founders, those that spread the word of the dangers of technology farther into the Wasteland. Who were our founders?"

 WBH_our_interim:0 "Our Interim"
 WBH_our_interim_desc:0 "Each chapter of the Brotherhood has its own priorities. Some focus on collecting the powerful weapons of the Old World, while some prioritise the industrial machniery and tools. What did we focus on?"

 WBH_our_future:0 "Our Future"
 WBH_our_future_desc:0 "We have learned plenty in the years that are now behind us. We must now use that experience and make preparations for the many years that are in front of us."

 WBH_water_operations:0 "Water Operations"
 WBH_water_operations_desc:0 "With secure access to a large body of water, we can begin to expand our operations to a naval theatre. Although we have little to no experience in such matters, we can look to prewar tactics for guidance."

 WBH_port_expansion:0 "Port Expansion"
 WBH_port_expansion_desc:0 "In order to host a fleet of operational size we require numerous facilities, such as drydocks, maintenance yards, piers, etc. In order to accomplish our goals we'll need to invest heavily in the expansion of our existing naval infrastructure."

 WBH_supporting_vessels:0 "Sea Raiders"
 WBH_supporting_vessels_desc:0 "Smaller and lighter craft make up the bulk of modern wasteland navies. To keep our edge in the seas we must invest in the production of simple, robust crafts, who can harass enemy vessels with ease."

 WBH_larger_vessels:0 "Siege Ships"
 WBH_larger_vessels_desc:0 "In order to make any kind of dent in an enemy navy, and to effectively support our troops on the shore, we need to be capable of building large ships capable of mounting large weaponry. Focusing on this will bring us closer to naval domination."

 WBH_reclaim_a_flagship:0 "Reclaim a Flagship"
 WBH_reclaim_a_flagship_desc:0 "Power projection is everything. In order to truly make our mark on the seas we cannot simply have an effective navy: we must also have an impressive one. A refitted flagship of the old world would suit our needs nicely."

 WBH_aerial_operations:0 "Aerial Operations"
 WBH_aerial_operations_desc:0 "Flexibility is something our organisation often lacks. In order to account for our weaknesses we must turn them into strengths. In the past, vast expeditions have been undertaken with the aid of aeiral equipment. We can learn from this."

 WBH_from_the_skies:0 "From The Skies"
 WBH_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Although we possess the knowledge to retrofit the most basic of aircraft, we have no knowledge on how to pilot them in combat, or how to utilise them tactically. We should turn to our databses and adapt as much information on prewar air tactics as we can"

 WBH_staging_bases:0 "Staging Bases"
 WBH_staging_bases_desc:0 "Aircraft are oversized paperweights without the proper facilities to maintain and arm them, and enough open space to take off and land. If we want to develop an effective airforce we need to scout for ideal locations to create airfields, and do just that."

 WBH_aerial_supremacy:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
 WBH_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "With our newfound understanding of ariel combat, we can begin to redesign our planes with the wasteland in mind. Cutting corners where possible will save us a lot of production time and valuable resources, both of which are things in scarce supply currently."

 WBH_wastelander_auxs:0 "Brotherhood Flight Academy"
 WBH_wastelander_auxs_desc:0 "Pilots are the lifeblood of an airforce, and our pilots need to make effective use of our limited supply of planes, ammunition, and equipment. Establishing a thorough training programme for pilots will not only make better use of our equipment, but it may provide us with a genuine ace."

 # Washington Brotherhood #

 WBH_within_the_blizzard:0 "Within The Blizzard"
 WBH_within_the_blizzard_desc:0 "Within the perpetural snow of the north, there's a city unlike any other: a city inhabited by ghosts. They say that if you step foot in their city you never return. Those vengeful spirits loathe the living, their eyes burn like orange coals of distorted desire. Dragging you deep, deep into their dark heart, they make you one of them."

 WBH_sinister_patriots:0 "Sinister Patriots"
 WBH_sinister_patriots_desc:0 "\"The north is where men lose their sense,\" that's what they say. Stubborn prospectors who ignore danger, foolish youths following dreams of spun silver, and desperate men with nothing left to lose: these are the pilgrims of the north. Their one and only port of call before the Endless White is the Old Country, a nation of prewar Ghouls who long for the days of yore."

 WBH_fellow_savages:0 "Fellow Savages"
 WBH_fellow_savages_desc:0 "Traders who brave the northern seas are as likely to curse Port Maw as they are to praise it. Small vessels are often molested in the open waters by pirates from Port Maw, their crews killed and their goods stolen. In darker corners of the port, pirates whisper about their dealings with ghosts. Slaves for guns, shiny things for lasers. Supposedly, one man even fished up an obelisk for them..."

 WBH_dark_ambitions:0 "Dark Ambitions"
 WBH_dark_ambitions_desc:0 "Sealed inside his armour, the Immortal has been leading his men since their days in the Midwestern Brotherhood. If his former Elder saw who he was today, he would be put down on the spot. The Immortal knows that he's been warped, changed, hollowed out. He doesn't lament what he's lost, and neither do the men who've followed him. They all know in their hearts that today's evil is tommorow's good."

 WBH_enslave_the_weak:0 "Enslave The Weak"
 WBH_enslave_the_weak_desc:0 "Tribal families make excellent workers, that's what the Washington Brotherhood decided soon after they'd wrested control of Seattle from the few dregs inhabiting it. If they wanted to restore the city and its facilities to their former glory they'd need workers... workers who wouldn't complain, who couldn't complain. Slavery is just another mean towards their end: morality is worthless."

 WBH_expand_our_dominion:0 "Expand Our Dominion"
 WBH_expand_our_dominion_desc:0 "It's not enough for the Brotherhood to simply rest in their citadel buried in the heart of Seattle. They need more: more slaves, more resources, more facilities... more more more. That's what the Immortal tells his men, it's what he mumbles to himself every day. More. The engines of war are turning again, because the Immortal demands it."

 WBH_eradicate_the_mutants:0 "Eradicate The Mutants"
 WBH_eradicate_the_mutants_desc:0 "The Immortal might be a ghoul but he has no sympathy for his kind. Ferals must die, as must supermutants. Troll Warren has long been a bastion for supermutants wandering the north, and their raids for raw human stock have been increasing lately. Enough is enough. The north must be wiped clean of scum before the real work can begin. This isn't genocide: it's mercy."

 WBH_black_paladins:0 "Black Paladins"
 WBH_black_paladins_desc:0 "Enslaving the weak and putting them to work isn't enough, we need to police them too. The strongest are picked to keep their brethren in line, and slowly but surely they begin to slip into our grasp. Once they're cruel and broken we take them into our ranks, burning the seal into their flesh. Black Paladins of the Washington Brotherhood are truly a terribly sad thing."

 WBH_decimate_and_despoil:0 "Decimate And Despoil"
 WBH_decimate_and_despoil_desc:0 "Mercy isn't a virtue, it's a weakness. The Immortal taught us this during the long journey to Seattle, he showed us the true path, a path of suffering and victory. All who cannot be forced to work must be purged. There's no room for compassion in this frozen wasteland."

 WBH_dark_foundries:0 "Dark Foundries"MOJ_ncr_raids
 WBH_dark_foundries_desc:0 "Deep within our facility lies an infernal machine whose engine burns like spent fire. It desires blood and coal. We will build a great cathedral of wrought iron and bloody furnances to wake its slumbering heart, so that it may gaze upon our desecration and reward us justly."

 WBH_death_or_glory:0 "Death Or Glory"
 WBH_death_or_glory_desc:0 "We came ot the north knowing that our lives were forefit, that there was no turning back once we left our former chapter. Seattle is a harsh mistress, her frosts threaten to destroy your servos and chill your bones - but her cold touch preserves the lost world. We have nothing left to lose, and everything left to gain."

 WBH_alaskan_expedition:0 "Great Alaskan Expedition"
 WBH_alaskan_expedition_desc:0 "Finally. Finally it's time to fulfill the Immortal's dream. Our scouts have been scouring Alaska for his onjective, and they found it. Buried into the side of a mountain, covered in ice, a bulkhead waits to be opened. It's time to send an expedition to reclaim that lost place."
