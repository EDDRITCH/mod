 nf_event_hea.1.t:0 "Legacy of Scripture"
 nf_event_hea.1.d:0 "The Heaven's Gate has always heeded the word of God, being directed by various prophets and leaders throughout its long history.

 nf_event_hea.1.a:0 "Ephesians 6:11"
 nf_event_hea.1.b:0 "Isaiah 1:19"

 nf_event_hea.2.t:0 "Pilgrims Cometh"
 nf_event_hea.2.d:0 "Those who make the journey to Heaven's Gate often travel great distances, knowing in their heart of hearts that somewhere past the horizon is the last true bastion of godliness in this forlorn and forgotten wasteland. Yet when they arrive, there is always the question. Has their pilgrimage ended, or are they now dutybound to seek out and lead the faithful here? What does the bible say of such things?"
 nf_event_hea.2.a:0 "Genesis 13:15"
 nf_event_hea.2.b:0 "Psalm 23:4"

 nf_event_hea.3.t:0 "Pagans Cometh"
 nf_event_hea.3.d:0 "Those who do not hear the word of God may still hear of the Gate, and may still travel here.

There are those who feel we should protect and house these lost souls, and those who believe that we should reject them."

 nf_event_hea.3.b:0 "Luke 12:30"

 nf_event_hea.4.t:0 "Innocence Lost"
 nf_event_hea.4.d:0 "Innocence is little more than a small settlement on the very edge of what we know, often visited by travelling pagans and tribals coming down from the northern wildlands. These people often arrive to trade and exchange goods, and in turn we teach them of God. Yet often, there are groups more resistance to this than others, those elders and warlike souls who feel that our lessons are an affront to their own misguided beliefs. Tensions run high, and our method of dealing with pagans will play a great part in what happens next..."
 nf_event_hea.4.a:0 "May God have mercy!"

 nf_event_hea.5.t:0 "Issue the Ultimatium"
 nf_event_hea.5.d:0 "The animist tribals of the Lonetree tribe have long stood independent to our south, surviving along primary land routes to the rich lands below us. We shall have to go forth and push them away, if only for the sake of travel. It is time for them to convert, we shall bring them salvation and open our southern trade routes."
 nf_event_hea.5.a:0 "What shall they say?"

 nf_event_hea.50.t:0 "Crusader Ultimatium"
 nf_event_hea.50.d:0 "The followers of the single God have come for us at last, long have we awaited this day. How shall we meet this ultimatum? With the pride of a warrior, or the wisdom of a sage who understands he can not win?"
