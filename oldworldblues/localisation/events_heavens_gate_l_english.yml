 nf_event_hea.1.t:0 "Legacy of Scripture"
 nf_event_hea.1.d:0 "The Heaven's Gate has always heeded the word of God, being directed by various prophets and leaders throughout its long history.

 nf_event_hea.1.a:0 "Ephesians 6:11"
 nf_event_hea.1.b:0 "Isaiah 1:19"

 nf_event_hea.2.t:0 "Pilgrims Cometh"
 nf_event_hea.2.d:0 "Those who make the journey to Heaven's Gate often travel great distances, knowing in their heart of hearts that somewhere past the horizon is the last true bastion of godliness in this forlorn and forgotten wasteland. Yet when they arrive, there is always the question. Has their pilgrimage ended, or are they now dutybound to seek out and lead the faithful here? What does the bible say of such things?"

 nf_event_hea.3.b:0 "Luke 12:30"

 nf_event_hea.4.t:0 "Innocence Lost"
 nf_event_hea.4.d:0 "Innocence is little more than a small settlement on the very edge of what we know, often visited by travelling pagans and tribals coming down from the northern wildlands. These people often arrive to trade and exchange goods, and in turn we teach them of God. Yet often, there are groups more resistance to this than others, those elders and warlike souls who feel that our lessons are an affront to their own misguided beliefs. Tensions run high, and our method of dealing with pagans will play a great part in what happens next..."
 nf_event_hea.4.a:0 "May God have mercy!"

 nf_event_hea.5.t:0 "Issue the Ultimatum"
 nf_event_hea.5.d:0 "The animist tribals of the Lonetree tribe have long stood independent to our south, surviving along primary land routes to the rich lands below us.

 nf_event_hea.8.d:0 "After the steady work of missionaries from Heaven's Gate, a large percentage of our population is loyal to the religious extremism coming from Heaven's Gate.

 nf_event_hea.90.d:0 "[From.GetName] was never going to like our coup in their puppet state. In response to our successful first takeover, they have launched a coup of their own to attempt to wrench back power. However, many militias rallied, formed of loyal followers, and managed to defend the capital from seizure. The country has been launched into a bloody civil war as a result."
