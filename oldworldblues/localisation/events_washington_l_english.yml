 nf_washington.2.t:0 "'Invitation' from the Washington Brotherhood"
 nf_washington.2.desc:0 "Beyond the borders of our proud nation, to the west where the water turns black, the ruins of Seattle fester like an untreated wound. A blizzard that never ends, streets packed with snow and forgotten bodies, and bright eyes peering up from below. Seattle is a city filled with ghosts. Ghosts that come out at night to steal people away, who jealously guard their broken capital from intruders. Now they've come to our door. An invitation from their immortal leader to embark on a journey to reclaim the old world. The man who delivered us the message stands silently, unmoving, outside in the snow - almost unnoticeable if not for the hum of his plasma rifle. To accept the invitation is to be welcomed... to refuse it is to die."
 nf_washington.2.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
 nf_washington.2.b:0 "Our proud nation shall not agree to such ridiculous demands"
 
 nf_washington.3.t:0 "'Invitation' from the Washington Brotherhood"
 nf_washington.3.desc:0 "Seattle used to be little more than a ruined city abandoned to the frost. Only the foolish and the desperate would dare venture that far into the frost. The men of the Maw weren't hardy enough to conquer the city - it was left forgotten. But at some point an infernal machine began to turn in that forsaken place, its dark masters slowly uncovering its machinations. Men in power armour that moved silently through the storm, who often visit the Maw to trade and to talk. Mysterious soldiers who kidnap entire communities, enslave them, and haul them into the white mist. But they're not here to trade today; they're here to offer us a deal we can't refuse. Join them in their conquest of the land, receive all the slaves and plunder we could ever desire - or we'll all be sent to Davy Jones' Locker."
 nf_washington.3.a:0 "This could be beneficial to us"
 nf_washington.3.b:0 "We will never be allies with the Brotherhoo!"
 
 nf_washington.4.t:0 "The Pact is Signed"
 nf_washington.4.desc:0 "Today the leader of the Old Country, Grozdan Haykov, was escorted to Capitol Hill by our men. By the time he arrived at the bulkhead to the inner sanctum he was clearly petrified, almost frozen stiff like his feral brethren out in the snow. The Immortal stood observing the obelisk within the chamber, speaking to the ghoul as he did so. Grozdan Haykov and his men would receive the gifts of power armour and plasma weaponry, and they would be called upon when needed. The pact was signed."
 nf_washington.4.a:0 "Just as expected"
 
 nf_washington.5.t:0 "The Old Country Refuses"
 nf_washington.5.desc:0 "The Immortal Elder looked down at the crumpled note in his hand with disgust, his armoured fist tightening around its frayed edges in rage. The Old Country had refused his offer of allegiance, their love of the old world having blinded them to the true nature of the wasteland. 'Take their settlements and raze them to the ground - leave none alive.' There was a silence in the room as his attendant left. 'We should have never put our faith in those mutants.'"
 nf_washington.5.a:0 "They will pay for this"
 
 nf_washington.6.t:0 "The Pact is Signed"
 nf_washington.6.desc:0 "Port Maw's mighty gate unfurled a deep red flag from atop its battlements, the dark sigil of the Washington Brotherhood displayed for all to see. Already numerous captains of the Maw and their officers could be seen in armour, their loyalty to the Maw's new allies rewarded for all to see. Although still independent for now, the Brotherhood had already sunk its dark roots deep into the foundations of the nation. Eventually it would be theirs."
 nf_washington.6.a:0 "Just as expected"
 
 nf_washington.7.t:0 "Port Maw Refuses"
 nf_washington.7.desc:0 "Fire swept across the Maw in the early hours of the morning, sailors looking on in horror as they found half the fleet ablaze under a red morning sky. Throughout the afternoon they laboured to douse the flames upon all the boats, and although none of them were lost, the real damage was to the sailor's hearts. In the night, while they slept in their cots, those tall figures had strode silently through the port to burn their ships. The message was clear - the Brotherhood would not forgive their transgression."
