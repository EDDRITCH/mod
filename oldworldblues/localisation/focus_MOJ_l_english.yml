 MOJ_our_founding:0 "Our Founding"
 MOJ_our_founding_desc:0 "While High Elder Maxson was the founder of the Brotherhood as a whole, each chapter has had its own founders, those that spread the word of the dangers of technology farther into the Wasteland. Who were our founders?"

 MOJ_our_interim:0 "Our Interim"
 MOJ_our_interim_desc:0 "Each chapter of the Brotherhood has its own priorities. Some focus on collecting the powerful weapons of the Old World, while some prioritise the industrial machniery and tools. What did we focus on?"

 MOJ_our_future:0 "Our Future"
 MOJ_our_future_desc:0 "We have learned plenty in the years that are now behind us. We must now use that experience and make preparations for the many years that are in front of us."

 MOJ_water_operations:0 "Water Operations"
 MOJ_water_operations_desc:0 "With secure access to a large body of water, we can begin to expand our operations to a naval theatre. Although we have little to no experience in such matters, we can look to prewar tactics for guidance."

 MOJ_port_expansion:0 "Port Expansion"
 MOJ_port_expansion_desc:0 "In order to host a fleet of operational size we require numerous facilities, such as drydocks, maintenance yards, piers, etc. In order to accomplish our goals we'll need to invest heavily in the expansion of our existing naval infrastructure."

 MOJ_supporting_vessels:0 "Sea Raiders"
 MOJ_supporting_vessels_desc:0 "Smaller and lighter craft make up the bulk of modern wasteland navies. To keep our edge in the seas we must invest in the production of simple, robust crafts, who can harass enemy vessels with ease."

 MOJ_larger_vessels:0 "Siege Ships"
 MOJ_larger_vessels_desc:0 "In order to make any kind of dent in an enemy navy, and to effectively support our troops on the shore, we need to be capable of building large ships capable of mounting large weaponry. Focusing on this will bring us closer to naval domination."

 MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship:0 "Reclaim a Flagship"
 MOJ_reclaim_a_flagship_desc:0 "Power projection is everything. In order to truly make our mark on the seas we cannot simply have an effective navy: we must also have an impressive one. A refitted flagship of the old world would suit our needs nicely."

 MOJ_aerial_operations:0 "Aerial Operations"
 MOJ_aerial_operations_desc:0 "Flexibility is something our organisation often lacks. In order to account for our weaknesses we must turn them into strengths. In the past, vast expeditions have been undertaken with the aid of aeiral equipment. We can learn from this."

 MOJ_from_the_skies:0 "From The Skies"
 MOJ_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Although we possess the knowledge to retrofit the most basic of aircraft, we have no knowledge on how to pilot them in combat, or how to utilise them tactically. We should turn to our databses and adapt as much information on prewar air tactics as we can."

 MOJ_staging_bases:0 "Staging Bases"
 MOJ_staging_bases_desc:0 "Aircraft are oversized paperweights without the proper facilities to maintain and arm them, and enough open space to take off and land. If we want to develop an effective airforce we need to scout for ideal locations to create airfields, and do just that."

 MOJ_aerial_supremacy:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
 MOJ_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "With our newfound understanding of ariel combat, we can begin to redesign our planes with the wasteland in mind. Cutting corners where possible will save us a lot of production time and valuable resources, both of which are things in scarce supply currently."

 MOJ_wastelander_auxs:0 "Brotherhood Flight Academy"
 MOJ_wastelander_auxs_desc:0 "Pilots are the lifeblood of an airforce, and our pilots need to make effective use of our limited supply of planes, ammunition, and equipment. Establishing a thorough training programme for pilots will not only make better use of our equipment, but it may provide us with a genuine ace."

 MOJ_our_right:0 "Our Right"
 MOJ_our_right_desc:0 "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."

 MOJ_salvaged_metal:0 "Salvaged Metal"
 MOJ_salvaged_metal_desc:0 "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."

 MOJ_increase_power_production:0 "Increase Power Production"
 MOJ_increase_power_production_desc:0 "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They create large amounts of power for relatively low maintenance cost, but they often require specific fuel cells and are difficult to redesign to fun off of corn fuel. Investing in power generation will always benefit our equipment output."

 MOJ_salvaged_electronics:0 "Salvaged Electronics"
 MOJ_salvaged_electronics_desc:0 "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."

 MOJ_advanced_tech:0 "Advanced Tech"
 MOJ_advanced_tech_desc:0 "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare prewar technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."

 MOJ_fueling_our_rise:0 "Fueling Our Rise"
 MOJ_fueling_our_rise_desc:0 "Fuel comes in all forms, but often our scavening parties search for the nuclear variety. Unspent fuel cells are incredibly valuable to everyone in the wasteland, but especially to us. They power our power armour, our gatling lasers, and our generators. Securing them is a high priority for all scouts."

 MOJ_arm_foundries:0 "Arms Foundries"
 MOJ_arm_foundries_desc:0 "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are undersupplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."

 MOJ_civilian_workshops:0 "Civilian Workshops"
 MOJ_civilian_workshops_desc:0 "Many of the bunkers and bases we seek to occupy were not left untouched by the Great War, and they require extensive repairs and excavation efforts to become fully usable. To ensure that we're prepared for future construction efforts, we should begin to develop a small industrial base of our own."

 MOJ_heavy_production:0 "Heavy Production"
 MOJ_heavy_production_desc:0 "With our civilian and military industry projects finished we're seeing our efforts pay off hand over fist. In order to continue to foster success and fuel our growth, we should launch a second, smaller construction effort, focusing on a mixture of both branches. Alongside this, we can set up infrastructure for future efforts, also."
