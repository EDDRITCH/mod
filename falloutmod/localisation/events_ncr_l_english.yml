 ncr.1.t:0 "The Boomers"
 ncr.1.d:0 "The Boomers would be an effective ally in Vegas, and their artillery would be invaluable in our defence of Hoover Dam. We should attempt to ally with them, or we may have to take their artillery by force."
 ncr.1.a:0 "Send a diplomat."
 ncr.1.b:0 "They would not ally with us."
 
 ncr.2.t:0 "The Great Khans"
 ncr.2.d:0 "The Great Khans have been an enemy of the NCR for ages, and seem to want to ally themselves with Caesar. We can change this diplomatically, if the right leadership is installed, or we can preemptively destroy the Khans."
 ncr.2.a:0 "A sympathetic leader is installed."
 ncr.2.b:0 "It is not worth the risk."
 
 ncr.3.t:0 "New Vegas"
 ncr.3.d:0 "Mr House is a wild card, and his own eyes set on Hoover Dam. Though he has been good to the NCR, he is an enemy of the Republic, and he must be removed from power if we are to succeed. If we sponsor NCR rule in New Vegas they can join us peacefully, otherwise we will need to remove him violently."
 ncr.3.a:0 "Vegas will join us."
 ncr.3.b:0 "We must remove all our enemies."
 
 ncr.4.t:0 "The Brotherhood"
 ncr.4.d:0 "We have discovered that the Brotherhood of Steel, who we have warred with in the past, still has an outpost in the Mojave. This is an enemy that must be removed before we can take the Mojave, either diplomatically or violently."
 ncr.4.a:0 "I choose peace."
 ncr.4.b:0 "They must be destroyed."
 
 ncr-boswar.1.t:0 "NCR Patrol Report"
 ncr-boswar.1.d:0 "Recently an NCR patrol found a large group of Brotherhood soldiers and scribes inhabiting a building in the heart of the Boneyard. Attempts to figure out what they're doing have been fruitless. When asked to leave, they declined - violently. Already a few NCR soldiers have died for "trespassing", and we're reaching a breaking point."
 ncr-boswar.1.a:0 "Send a messenger"
 ncr-boswar.1.b:0 "Storm the building"
 
 ncr-boswar.2.t:0 "NCR Messenger"
 ncr-boswar.2.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning a man approached the sealed doors of one of our bunkers near NCR territory. He claims to be a messenger sent by the Californian brass, and so we took his message and told him to await our reply. The NCR are accusing us of sending a Brotherhood patrol to the Boneyard, without their permission. They made it especially clear that the patrol has already killed many NCR soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.2.a:0 "Tell them they were acting without orders"
 ncr-boswar.2.b:0 "Tell the NCR to return our men"
 
 ncr-boswar.3.t:0 "Scene Of Battle"
 ncr-boswar.3.d:0 "A month ago a large group of our soldiers went missing with a small contingent of Scribes. After much searching we finally found them thanks to a distress signal. We arrived at the scene of a bloody battle, with laser burns and bullet holes across the entire building. We searched the ruin for any signs of technology, or survivors, and found nothing... nothing except a few pairs of NCR dogtags lost under the rubble."
 ncr-boswar.3.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
 ncr-boswar.3.b:0 "We don't want to poke the bear"
 
 ncr-boswar.4.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.4.d:0 "Our messenger has come back to us shaken, but unharmed. The message he carries from the Brotherhood is blunt and to the point. "Our soldiers were acting without orders, they must have gone AWOL over something important." Whether we believe them or not, one thing is certain: the Brotherhood soldiers we found were in a West-Tek facility."
 ncr-boswar.4.a:0 "Extend an olive branch"
 ncr-boswar.4.b:0 "We can't trust them"
 
 ncr-boswar.5.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.5.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson was reaching a breaking point, but one of the senators, a man by the name of Sean All-Good Murphy stepped in to calm the President."
 ncr-boswar.5.a:0 "Send him to the Brotherhood"
 
 ncr-boswar.6.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.6.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson crushed the message in the ball of his fist in rage. The audacity!"
 ncr-boswar.6.a:0 "Mobilise the army!"
 
 ncr-boswar.7.t:0 "Scouting Party Returns"
 ncr-boswar.7.d:0 "We've received word from our AWOL soldiers that the NCR allowed them to leave the Boneyard without complications. Supposedly they're bringing some seven holotapes of unknown value back with them; but since they're from a West-Tek facility they will be invaluable to our efforts to understand and preserve technology."
 ncr.boswar.7.a:0 "Punish them for acting without orders"
 
 ncr-boswar.8.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
 ncr-boswar.8.d:0 "We've been given an ultimatum by the NCR. Either we give them compensation for the deaths of their soldiers, or there will be "repercussions". "
 ncr-boswar.8.a:0 "Pay the compensation"
 ncr-boswar.8.b:0 "Compensation? For what?"
 
 ncr-boswar.9.t:0 "All-Good Returns"
 ncr-boswar.9.d:0 "Our demands have not gone unnoticed. The NCR have sent All-Good to speak with us once again. As ever he came to us nervous but undaunted, and we began to discuss the current situation. Sean stresses that he was only barely able to keep the NCR from declaring all-out war for our "hubris" and seeks to find a compromise. "
 ncr-boswar.9.a:0 "We must find a peaceful solution"
 ncr-boswar.9.b:0 "We must have our men returned"
 
 ncr-boswar.10.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.10.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson flew into a fit of fury, but a senator by the name of Sean Murphy stepped forward to calm him. This man, "All-Good", proposed simply letting the soldiers go. He knows the Brotherhood, and made a convincing argument that open conflict would put the NCR through a gauntlet it could entirely avoid."
 ncr-boswar.10.a:0 "We can't risk a war"
 
 ncr-boswar.11.t:0 "Brotherhood Refusal"
 ncr-boswar.11.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson is outraged at the continued audacity of the Brotherhood, and nobody steps forward to offer any kind of alternatives."
 ncr-boswar.11.a:0 "To hell with diplomacy!"
 
 ncr-boswar.12.t:0 "Successful Mission"
 ncr-boswar.12.d:0 "All-Good returned from the Brotherhood optimistically. They're willing to find a compromise to the issue as long as it's reasonable, and Sean is telling us to take them up on this offer. He suggests we ask the Brotherhood to detain their soldiers who killed our soldiers, for a number of years they find reasonable, and they can keep the rest. All we need, he says, is justice for our dead soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.12.a:0 "Hopefully the Brotherhood keep their end"
 ncr-boswar.12.b:0 "No repercussions? To hell with that!"
 
 ncr-boswar.13.t:0 "Diplomacy Wins Out"
 ncr-boswar.13.d:0 "We've received word that the Brotherhood have sentenced the soldiers responsible for killing our men. Five years for one man, and two for the other three. The Brotherhood have sent a formal thank you to us for allowing them to carry out the sentence."
 ncr-boswar.13.a:0 "The sentences are too short, but at least we avoided more bloodshed"
 
 ncr-boswar.14.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down"
 ncr-boswar.14.d:0 "Negotiations have broken down with the NCR. All-Good sent us a message ahead of time informing us of the worst, and the Elders are demanding the NCR be silenced once and for all."
 ncr-boswar.14.a:0 "The NCR were responsible for their own destruction"
 
 hooverdam.1.t:0 "The Old World Wall"
 hooverdam.1.d:0 "NCR Scouts have identified a vast structure bridging the Mojave and the distant Colorado. The 'Hoover Dam' holds a large resevoir of drinking water, and the current occupants have proven the Dam is a great source of electricity. It would definitely be a great asset for us to have."
 hooverdam.1.a:0 "Evict the raider occupants."
 hooverdam.1.b:0 "Force out the Brotherhood!"
 hooverdam.1.c:0 "We are met by securitrons looking to treatise."
 hooverdam.2.t:0 "1st Battle For Hoover Dam"
 hooverdam.2.d:0 "Our forces have arrived on the shores of the Colorado, the Dam in clear site. The Malpais Legate has set up camp on the hill opposite the Dam, and his troops have begun training drills. As the mighty Caesar sets foot in the camp, his whole Legion awaits his order with baited breath."
 hooverdam.2.a:0 "We will lightly probe their forces, hoping for a counter-attack on our turf."
 hooverdam.2.b:0 "We will commit our forces to a heavy attack."
 hooverdam.2.c:0 "Hordes of our troops will be thrown at the Dam."
 hooverdam.3.t:0 "The Legion Is Victorious"
 hooverdam.3.d:0 "Legion forces have captured and now occupy the Dam and the NCR are in full retreat. The Malpais Legate suggests we should press on, and erradicate the NCR forces at Boulder City."
 hooverdam.3.a:0 "Encircle the NCR in Boulder City."
 hooverdam.3.b:0 "The Dam was our goal, let the NCR retreat."
 hooverdam.4.t:0 "The NCR Is Victorious"
 hooverdam.4.d:0 "Our forces have held out at the Dam, and the Legion is clearly wounded. Though we have already been victorious, Ranger Chief Hanlon warns that the Legion will not be stopped now. He says we should press on,  wipe out their forces, and prepare for the coming war by taking Bonelli Landing."
 hooverdam.4.a:0 "Rally the troops!"
 hooverdam.4.b:0 "Fortify our position at the Dam."
 hooverdam.5.t:0 "Defense Of Boulder City"
 hooverdam.5.d:0 "After our disasterous defeat at the Dam, our forces have retreated into Boulder City. Ranger Chief Hanlon has asked us to commit a large force to distract the Legion while his Rangers and the 1st Recon destroy the Legion's forces."
 hooverdam.5.a:0 "Commit a light force to defend our retreat."
 hooverdam.5.b:0 "Meet the Legion in a stalemate."
 hooverdam.5.c:0 "Go with Hanlon's plan."
 hooverdam.6.t:0 "Defense Of Bonelli Landing"
 hooverdam.6.d:0 "To our surprise, the NCR was victorious at the Dam, and even now presses on further. Caesar is furious at the Malpais Legate and now stands to lose his entrance into the Mojave. The scattered Legion forces must be unified for a defense."
 hooverdam.6.a:0 "We dont have the manpower to spare."
 hooverdam.6.b:0 "Hope the Malpais Legate entrenches soon."
 hooverdam.6.c:0 "Throw everything we have at the oncoming NCR."
 hooverdam.7.t:0 "The Legion Takes Boulder"
 hooverdam.7.d:0 "The NCR were utterly demolished at the offensive on Boulder City. The Malpais Legate has returned to great triumph, while a reserve force remains in our new land. Caesar, ever cunning, has already formed plans to conquer the Mojave out of Boulder."
 hooverdam.8.t:0 "The NCR Pushes Back"
 hooverdam.8.d:0 "Our defense of Boulder City was successful, and the shattered Legion forces retreated back to the other side of the Colorado. NCR Troops retook the Dam this morning, and the Two Headed Bear flies higher than ever over the Mojave."
 hooverdam.9.t:0 "The Legion Pushes Back"
 hooverdam.9.d:0 "Our Legions held Bonelli Landing in spectacular form, and the NCR's forces were completely destroyed. Now routed, the Malpais Legate is chasing them back into the Mojave, and our forces have taken the Dam. The NCR's flag has been torn down and burnt, and the Bull now flies over Hoover Dam."
 hooverdam.10.t:0 "The NCR Takes Bonelli"
 hooverdam.10.d:0 "After our victory at the Dam, our forces continued on to Bonelli, hoping to wipe out the Legion's assault once and for all. Our Generals report great sucess, and the area around Bonelli Landing is now under NCR patrol."
 hooverdam.11.t:0 "1st Battle For Hoover Dam"
 hooverdam.11.d:0 "NCR Forces in the Mojave have arrived at the border of Legion territory. The High Command of the NCR have set up camp, forming battle plans to take Hoover Dam. The men, weary from their long march, have one night of rest before the tremendous battle to come."
