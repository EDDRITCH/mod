 ncr.1.t:0 "The Boomers"
 ncr.1.d:0 "The Boomers would be an effective ally in Vegas, and their artillery would be invaluable in our defence of Hoover Dam. We should attempt to ally with them, or we may have to take their artillery by force."
 ncr.1.a:0 "Send a diplomat."
 ncr.1.b:0 "They would not ally with us."
 
 ncr.2.t:0 "The Great Khans"
 ncr.2.d:0 "The Great Khans have been an enemy of the NCR for ages, and seem to want to ally themselves with Caesar. We can change this diplomatically, if the right leadership is installed, or we can preemptively destroy the Khans."
 ncr.2.a:0 "A sympathetic leader is installed."
 ncr.2.b:0 "It is not worth the risk."
 
 ncr.3.t:0 "New Vegas"
 ncr.3.d:0 "Mr House is a wild card, and his own eyes set on Hoover Dam. Though he has been good to the NCR, he is an enemy of the Republic, and he must be removed from power if we are to succeed. If we sponsor NCR rule in New Vegas they can join us peacefully, otherwise we will need to remove him violently."
 ncr.3.a:0 "Vegas will join us."
 ncr.3.b:0 "We must remove all our enemies."
 
 ncr.4.t:0 "The Brotherhood"
 ncr.4.d:0 "We have discovered that the Brotherhood of Steel, who we have warred with in the past, still has an outpost in the Mojave. This is an enemy that must be removed before we can take the Mojave, either diplomatically or violently."
 ncr.4.a:0 "I choose peace."
 ncr.4.b:0 "They must be destroyed."
 
 ncr-boswar.1.t:0 "NCR Patrol Report"
 ncr-boswar.1.d:0 "Recently an NCR patrol found a large group of Brotherhood soldiers and scribes inhabiting a building in the heart of the Boneyard. Attempts to figure out what they're doing have been fruitless. When asked to leave, they declined - violently. Already a few NCR soldiers have died for "trespassing", and we're reaching a breaking point."
 ncr-boswar.1.a:0 "Send a messenger"
 ncr-boswar.1.b:0 "Storm the building"
 
 ncr-boswar.2.t:0 "NCR Messenger"
 ncr-boswar.2.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning a man approached the sealed doors of one of our bunkers near NCR territory. He claims to be a messenger sent by the Californian brass, and so we took his message and told him to await our reply. The NCR are accusing us of sending a Brotherhood patrol to the Boneyard, without their permission. They made it especially clear that the patrol has already killed many NCR soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.2.a:0 "Tell them they were acting without orders"
 ncr-boswar.2.b:0 "Tell the NCR to return our men"
 
 ncr-boswar.3.t:0 "Scene Of Battle"
 ncr-boswar.3.d:0 "A month ago a large group of our soldiers went missing with a small contingent of Scribes. After much searching we finally found them thanks to a distress signal. We arrived at the scene of a bloody battle, with laser burns and bullet holes across the entire building. We searched the ruin for any signs of technology, or survivors, and found nothing... nothing except a few pairs of NCR dogtags lost under the rubble."
 ncr-boswar.3.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
 ncr-boswar.3.b:0 "We don't want to poke the bear"
 
 ncr-boswar.4.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.4.d:0 "Our messenger has come back to us shaken, but unharmed. The message he carries from the Brotherhood is blunt and to the point. "Our soldiers were acting without orders, they must have gone AWOL over something important." Whether we believe them or not, one thing is certain: the Brotherhood soldiers we found were in a West-Tek facility."
 ncr-boswar.4.a:0 "Extend an olive branch"
 ncr-boswar.4.b:0 "We can't trust them"
 
 ncr-boswar.5.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.5.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson was reaching a breaking point, but one of the senators, a man by the name of Sean All-Good Murphy stepped in to calm the President."
 ncr-boswar.5.a:0 "Send him to the Brotherhood"
 
 ncr-boswar.6.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.6.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson crushed the message in the ball of his fist in rage. The audacity!"
 ncr-boswar.6.a:0 "Mobilise the army!"
 
 ncr-boswar.7.t:0 "Scouting Party Returns"
 ncr-boswar.7.d:0 "We've received word from our AWOL soldiers that the NCR allowed them to leave the Boneyard without complications. Supposedly they're bringing some seven holotapes of unknown value back with them; but since they're from a West-Tek facility they will be invaluable to our efforts to understand and preserve technology."
 ncr.boswar.7.a:0 "Punish them for acting without orders"
 
 ncr-boswar.8.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
 ncr-boswar.8.d:0 "We've been given an ultimatum by the NCR. Either we give them compensation for the deaths of their soldiers, or there will be "repercussions". "
 ncr-boswar.8.a:0 "Pay the compensation"
 ncr-boswar.8.b:0 "Compensation? For what?"
 
 ncr-boswar.9.t:0 "All-Good Returns"
 ncr-boswar.9.d:0 "Our demands have not gone unnoticed. The NCR have sent All-Good to speak with us once again. As ever he came to us nervous but undaunted, and we began to discuss the current situation. Sean stresses that he was only barely able to keep the NCR from declaring all-out war for our "hubris" and seeks to find a compromise. "
 ncr-boswar.9.a:0 "We must find a peaceful solution"
 ncr-boswar.9.b:0 "We must have our men returned"
 
 ncr-boswar.10.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.10.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson flew into a fit of fury, but a senator by the name of Sean Murphy stepped forward to calm him. This man, "All-Good", proposed simply letting the soldiers go. He knows the Brotherhood, and made a convincing argument that open conflict would put the NCR through a gauntlet it could entirely avoid."
 ncr-boswar.10.a:0 "We can't risk a war"
 
 ncr-boswar.11.t:0 "Brotherhood Refusal"
 ncr-boswar.11.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson is outraged at the continued audacity of the Brotherhood, and nobody steps forward to offer any kind of alternatives."
 ncr-boswar.11.a:0 "To hell with diplomacy!"
 
 ncr-boswar.12.t:0 "Successful Mission"
 ncr-boswar.12.d:0 "All-Good returned from the Brotherhood optimistically. They're willing to find a compromise to the issue as long as it's reasonable, and Sean is telling us to take them up on this offer. He suggests we ask the Brotherhood to detain their soldiers who killed our soldiers, for a number of years they find reasonable, and they can keep the rest. All we need, he says, is justice for our dead soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.12.a:0 "Hopefully the Brotherhood keep their end"
 ncr-boswar.12.b:0 "No repercussions? To hell with that!"
 
 ncr-boswar.13.t:0 "Diplomacy Wins Out"
 ncr-boswar.13.d:0 "We've received word that the Brotherhood have sentenced the soldiers responsible for killing our men. Five years for one man, and two for the other three. The Brotherhood have sent a formal thank you to us for allowing them to carry out the sentence."
 ncr-boswar.13.a:0 "The sentences are too short, but at least we avoided more bloodshed"
 
 ncr-boswar.14.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down"
 ncr-boswar.14.d:0 "Negotiations have broken down with the NCR. All-Good sent us a message ahead of time informing us of the worst, and the Elders are demanding the NCR be silenced once and for all."
 ncr-boswar.14.a:0 "The NCR were responsible for their own destruction"
