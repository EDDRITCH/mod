 ces_death:0 "Death In The Canyons"
 ces_death_desc:0 "The earliest years of the Legion were also some of the most brutal. In his conquest of the Canyons, Caesar brutally slaughtered three of the local tribes, each act just as cruel. But one act gained particular infamy in the wastes."
 ces_malpais:0 "The Malpais Legate"
 ces_malpais_desc:0 "Joshua Graham, the Malpais Legate, was the co-founder of the Legion, and Caesar's greatest servant. A shrewd, cunning general - this early act cemented his legend across the Legion, and formed the basis of his military prowess."
 ces_ces:0 "Caesar, Son Of Mars"
 ces_ces_desc:0 "Caesar's will is law. He is a god amongst men, the son of the god of war, Mars. All in his legion live to serve him, as a blade serves his master. He is the teacher and master of the tribes under him - and in his conquest, taught them many lessons."
 ces_alea:0 "Alea Iacta Est"
 ces_alea_desc:0 "Alea Iacta Est, the die is cast, the words spoken by Caesar's namesake as he stood against Rome. These are the words that began the immortal empire, the words that again shall begin a great empire of Caesar's."

 ces_diana:0 "Goddess Diana"
 ces_diana_desc:0 "The Twin Mothers tribe we have recently enslaved persist in their belief that their goddess Diana is real. Often, they refuse to bind Legionnaire's wounds in protest. Acknowledging their godess as Caesar's equal may subdue them."
 ces_nascar:0 "The Cult Of Nas"
 ces_nascar_desc:0 "The recently conquered tribe of Two Sun worshipped a god they called 'Nas' - the god that purportedly gave them their vehicles and the skills to use it. If we allow worship of this god, they will retain their great skill at driving."

 ces_godslayer:0 "Caesar The Godslayer"
 ces_godslayer_desc:0 "Caesar will teach the Twin Mothers their final lesson. Their goddess is nothing more than an illusion - and can be slain. With their tribe broken and enslaved, they will be chained to Caesar's will - and used as healers for the Legion."

 ces_conqueror_desc:0 "With these final tribals conquered, the Legion is now made up of 86. An impressive title, the feat of conquering and assimilating 86 tribes is unprecedented in the Wasteland."

 ces_valley:0 "Annex Hidden Valley"
 ces_valley_desc:0 "With the Mojave Brotherhood defeated, the Legion now controls Hidden Valley and the surrounding desert. Annexing this into the Legion, providing some colonists and infrastructure, will give us a base in the Mojave."

 ces_judea:0 "New Iudea"
 ces_judea_desc:0 "The Rome of old once conquered the province of Iudea - then Israel, where Christianity was born. The Mormons, building a New Canaan in Utah, seem to be inviting a New Iudea upon themselves."
 ces_petition:0 "The White Legs Petition"
 ces_petition_desc:0 "The White Legs, a nearby tribe, have repeatedly petitioned to join the Legion. As we now have a use for them, we should allow them to join in future, so long as they attack the New Canaanites for us."
 ces_loyal:0 "Reward The Loyal Tribe"
 ces_loyal_desc:0 "Let it not be said that Caesar does not reward loyalty. The White Legs, thanks to their loyalty in helping to attack the Canaanites, should be rewarded, and promised eventual assimilation."
 ces_80s:0 "Calling Upon The Nomads"
 ces_80s_desc:0 "The White Legs have failed us, refusing to attack the Canaanites. Such insolence will not go unpunished. Another tribe in Utah, the nomadic 80s, can be used as a tool, to remove the Canaanites and later, the White Legs."

 ces_rubicon:0 "Crossing The Rubicon"
 ces_rubicon_desc:0 "Caesar's ancient namesake once crossed a river named the Rubicon, an unprecedented move that pitted him against Rome so that he could usurp it as Emperor. Similairly, our Legion crossing the Colorado River signifies total war."
 ces_spqr:0 "S.P.Q.R."
 ces_spqr_desc:0 "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Vulpes Inculta emerged victorious. This move will likely mean the Legion becoming less of a military force, but Vulpes Inculta has many strengths of his own."
 ces_lanius:0 "Monster Of The East"
 ces_lanius_desc:0 "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Legate Lanius, the rightful heir of Caesar, emerged victorious. Though some criticise his barbaric methods, he is undoubtedly a fierce commander and great conqueror."

 ces_dam:0 "War For Hoover Dam"
 ces_dam_desc:0 "The Dam is our only way into Nevada, into the Mojave - where our Rome lies, New Vegas. The Dam is also a spectacular prize, but all of this has been claimed by the Bear. We must go to war with the NCR to claim the Dam back."
 ces_burnedman:0 "The Burned Man"
 ces_burnedman_desc:0 "The war for the Dam was lost, and somebody must be held responsible. Joshua Graham, once the most esteemed general in the Legion, was largely at fault for the failed offensive. An example must be made of him."
 ces_triumph:0 "Triumph At The Dam"

 ces_wounds:0 "Lick The Bull's Wounds"

 ces_fortify:0 "Fortify The Dam"
 ces_fortify_desc:0 "Hoover Dam is naturally a heavily fortified location - but as such an important strategic location, we can afford to be over-cautious. Upping the legionaries assigned to the Dam, and constructing fortified towers - will make it harder to siege."
 ces_forthill:0 "The Fort"
 ces_forthill_desc:0 "Fortification Hill, just before the Dam, is a prime location to begin the rebuilding of forces to retake the Dam. We should construct a camp there, to train new legionaries and command from."

 ces_lights:0 "The Lights Of Vegas"
 ces_lights_desc:0 "The Lights of Vegas shine from end to end of the Mojave wastes. A beacon to some, a target for us. To build our Nova Roma, we must first wrest control of New Vegas from Mr House and the Families."
 ces_eternal:0 "The Eternal City"
 ces_eternal_desc:0 "Just as the city of ancient Rome was once described as 'the Eternal City' - so shall New Vegas. The Strip never closes, and the caps never stop flowing."
 ces_palace:0 "Caesar's Palace"
 ces_palace_desc:0 "Deep in the ruined parts of the Strip, a casino called 'Caesar's Palace' has been unearthed. It seems it was almost destiny for the Legion to take the Strip, and discover this palace. Caesar has taken the casino as his seat of power, and begun reconstruction efforts."
 ces_open:0 "Break The Bank"
 ces_open_desc:0 "The Lucky 38 stands tall, watching over the Strip. Inside, Mr House must have housed many treasures and, as it has not been opened since before the war, much pre-war technology."

 ces_mccarran:0 "McCarran Airstrip"

 ces_strip:0 "Scourging The Strip"
 ces_strip_desc:0 "The Strip was once used by the NCR to improve morale by its soldiers. Such decadence and debauchery is uncharacteristic of a proper military force, so we will scourge the Strip, and use it to arm our soldiers."
 ces_novaroma:0 "Nova Roma"
 ces_novaroma_desc:0 "New Vegas, now fully under Legion control, and repurposed to house our seat of government, is ready to be occupied. Already, many flock to the outlying areas to settle, as Caesar moves his court here from Flagstaff."
 ces_augustus:0 "Crown A New Augustus"
 ces_augustus_desc:0 "The civil war has been won, and the leader of the Legion has changed. It would be fitting to have a ceremony to crown him as the new Augustus, to quell any opposition and restore unity."
 ces_thesis:0 "The New Thesis"
 ces_thesis_desc:0 "Caesar lived, despite his dehabilitating disease, in part due to specialised technology and excellent healers. Now, with his rule over the Legion consolidated, Caesar can implement his philosophy and instate the New Thesis, a combination of the Legion and NCR."

 ces_brotherhood_desc:0 "In the gruelling civil war that followed Caesar's revival, the legions of the Brotherhood of Mars successfully overthrew Caesar and threw off the shackles he had placed on technology. Now, Lucius stands to reform the Legion as a technologically advanced nation."

 ces_peace_desc:0 "Pax Per Bellum. 'Peace through War' - an ancient Roman saying used to justify their conquests of the known world. Peace can only be achieved by holding dominion over all people, by all living under one banner."
 ces_worthy:0 "A Worthy Foe"
 ces_worthy_desc:0 "For the first time, the Legion has encountered a foe perhaps more powerful than itself, and the first foe that Caesar is ideologically opposed to. The NCR is, indeed, a worthy foe for Caesar's fledgling Legion."
 ces_divide:0 "Divide Et Impera"
 ces_divide_desc:0 "Divide Et Impera, or 'divide and conquer' - is the principle of dividing a larger power into smaller powers, in order to better conquer or rule over the parts. By attacking key areas of the NCR, we can weaken them enough to be more easily conquered."
 ces_searchlight:0 "Camp Searchlight"
 ces_searchlight_desc:0 "Vulpes Inculta has come to us with a plan. The NCR Camp in the town of Searchlight could easily be sabotaged by opening some irradiated barrels of nuclear waste inside the town, irradiating the town and the NCR soldiers within."
 ces_nelson:0 "Battle Of Nelson"
 ces_nelson_desc:0 "The town of Nelson, though only small, could prove an extremely important strategic point to launch assaults on the NCR in Mojave. By expending some manpower to take, we can seize the town as a base across the Colorado."
 ces_ncrwar:0 "In Hoc Signo Taurus Vinces"
 ces_ncrwar_desc:0 "In the sign of the bull, we shall conquer. The NCR will fall beneath the might of the Legion, and its lands will be conquered. All the preparation has been taken, and it is time to declare war."
 ces_render:0 "Render Unto Caesar"
 ces_render_desc:0 "The NCR has many enemies, in the Mojave and beyond. Diplomats should be sent out to these enemies, offering them a chance at an alliance, so long as they render unto Caesar."
 ces_khans:0 "The Great Khans"
 ces_khans_desc:0 "Our diplomats have found great success in the court of the Great Khans, ancient enemies of the NCR since before they were even a state. Papa Khan, their leader, expresses great interest in warring with the NCR."
 ces_baja:0 "The Baja Raiders"
 ces_baja_desc:0 "Far beyond the Mojave, in the land of 'Baja California' are two clans of raiders, whose hatred of each other is rivalled only by their hatred of the NCR. They can be convinced to join us against the NCR."
 ces_mexico:0 "Mexican Expansion"
 ces_mexico_desc:0 "South of Caesar's territory is the land of Mexico. It is a prime point of expansion, with many weak tribes and nations. Should the Legion's army find themselves in Mexico, their conquest would be easy."
 ces_baudelio:0 "The Baudelio Ranchers"
 ces_baudelio_desc:0 "The Baudelio Ranchers are a peaceful group of settlers who occupy a large swathe of land called the Baudelio. They would not stand a chance against the Legion."
 ces_ranchers:0 "Enslave The Ranchers"
 ces_ranchers_desc:0 "The Ranchers of Baudelio were exceptional at grazing Brahmin and taming Bighorners. If we enslave them, they can continue to produce food and other goods for the Legion."
