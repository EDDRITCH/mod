 nf_vegas.1.t:0 "The Great War"
 nf_vegas.1.d:0 "There was only ever one constant in Vegas, and it was change. I was almost fully prepared to prevent the apocalypse from touching my desert jewel, but without the Platinum Chip, I couldn't stop every missile."
 nf_vegas.1.a:0 "I prioritized protecting the suburbs in the few seconds I had to spare"
 nf_vegas.1.b:0 "My laser defences targeted missiles headed for military industry"
 nf_vegas.2.t:0 "Unstable System"
 nf_vegas.2.d:0 "Without the Platinum Chip, I couldn't upgrade my Securitrons or my defenses. Numerous power cuts, rampant data corruption, and a coma were the result of my failure. I was faced with a painful choice, reusing an older and very stable version of my prewar OS, or attempting to salvage and use an incomplete OS, which was designed to be more capable of addressing wasteland threats."

 nf_vegas.3.t:0 "Selecting the Pawns"
 nf_vegas.3.d:0 "Before the war, Las-Vegas was a city of dreams, where fortunes were won and lost in an instant. To recapture that feeling and reap the profits, to draw a crowd from across the wasteland with bright neon lights... I need to reopen the casinos, and they needed families to run them."
 nf_vegas.3.a:0 "Vegas shall become the shining jewel of humanity's future"
 nf_vegas.4.t:0 "Reopening Gomorrah"
 nf_vegas.4.d:0 "Gomorrah was a thriving casino before the Great War. Its faux-Persian decor and sex appeal made it a popular destination. In the new age, I desire a criminal element within Vegas; not simply for the nostalgia, but because a thriving black market makes business better for all of us."
 nf_vegas.4.a:0 "Slither Kin, a gang of nomads who dealt in drugs and prostitution, were easily persuaded to become the heads of a crime empire."
 nf_vegas.4.b:0 "I saw in the Fiends a kind of cunning unlike most other raider groups. I used their reliance on energy weapons against them."
 nf_vegas.5.t:0 "Reopening The Tops"
 nf_vegas.5.d:0 "The Tops was the casino for the middle-class man, offering simple luxuries and exclusive entertainment. To recapture that feeling I require a group of loyal wastelanders who know how to make others feel welcome."
 nf_vegas.5.a:0 "The Geckos crawled through the ruins in search of heads to scalp and shiny things. They're were fools, but I made them loyal to me."
 nf_vegas.5.b:0 "An old building in the Vegas suburbs hosted a gang of men who called themselves the Kings - they made fine hosts for The Tops."
