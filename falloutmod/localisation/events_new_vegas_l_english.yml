 nf_vegas.1.t:0 "The Great War"
 nf_vegas.1.d:0 "There was only ever one constant in Vegas, and it was change. I was almost fully prepared to prevent the apocalypse from touching my desert jewel, but without the Platinum Chip, I couldn't stop every missile."
 nf_vegas.1.a:0 "I prioritized protecting the suburbs in the few seconds I had to spare"
 nf_vegas.1.b:0 "My laser defences targeted missiles headed for military industry"
 nf_vegas.2.t:0 "Unstable System"
 nf_vegas.2.d:0 "Without the Platinum Chip, I couldn't upgrade my Securitrons or my defenses. Numerous power cuts, rampant data corruption, and a coma were the result of my failure. I was faced with a painful choice, reusing an older and very stable version of my prewar OS, or attempting to salvage and use an incomplete OS, which was designed to be more capable of addressing wasteland threats."
 nf_vegas.2.a:0 "I reinstalled a much older and stable version of my OS."
 nf_vegas.2.b:0 "I took a risk and attempted to salvage parts of the incomplete OS."
 nf_vegas.3.t:0 "Selecting the Pawns"
 nf_vegas.3.d:0 "Before the war, Las-Vegas was a city of dreams, where fortunes were won and lost in an instant. To recapture that feeling and reap the profits, to draw a crowd from across the wasteland with bright neon lights... I need to reopen the casinos, and they needed families to run them."
 nf_vegas.3.a:0 "Vegas shall become the shining jewel of humanity's future"
 nf_vegas.4.t:0 "Reopening Gomorrah"
 nf_vegas.4.d:0 "Gomorrah was a thriving casino before the Great War. Its faux-Persian decor and sex appeal made it a popular destination. In the new age, I desire a criminal element within Vegas; not simply for the nostalgia, but because a thriving black market makes business better for all of us."
 nf_vegas.4.a:0 "Slither Kin, a gang of nomads who dealt in drugs and prostitution, were easily persuaded to become the heads of a crime empire."
 nf_vegas.4.b:0 "I saw in the Fiends a kind of cunning unlike most other raider groups. I used their reliance on energy weapons against them."
 nf_vegas.5.t:0 "Reopening The Tops"
 nf_vegas.5.d:0 "The Tops was the casino for the middle-class man, offering simple luxuries and exclusive entertainment. To recapture that feeling I require a group of loyal wastelanders who know how to make others feel welcome."
 nf_vegas.5.a:0 "The Boot Riders crawled through the ruins in search of heads to scalp and shiny things. They're were fools, but I made them loyal to me."
 nf_vegas.5.b:0 "An old building in the Vegas suburbs hosted a gang of men who called themselves the Kings - they made fine hosts for The Tops."
 nf_vegas.6.t:0 "Reopening Ultra-Luxe"
 nf_vegas.6.d:0 "Tucked away into the far corner of the strip is the Ultra-Luxe, a beacon of prewar luxury which served only the highest class of clientele. Vegas welcomes all to empty their pockets, and a down trodden group attempting to cover up past misdeeds would be the perfect hosts."
 nf_vegas.6.a:0 "Cannibalism was common in primitive tribes, and proved to be an effective control measure to keep the Ultra-Luxe in line."
 nf_vegas.6.b:0 "Their stunning fall from grace had left the Great Khans bitter. An opportunity to gain power again was be irresistible."
 nf_vegas.7.t:0 "Expansion: Inwards or Outwards?"
 nf_vegas.7.d:0 "My New Vegas was slowly coming together despite my early awakening, but decisions remained. I could either focus my attention on creating a rich, inner Vegas, and a poor "Freeside": or I could attempt to include all of Vegas into my grand vision."
 nf_vegas.7.a:0 "Inner Vegas was my priority, it was predicted to make the most profit."
 nf_vegas.7.b:0 "Outer Vegas wasn't terribly wealthy, but improving the entire sprawl would bolster public support."
 nf_vegas.47.t:0 "Benny's Army"
 nf_vegas.47.d:0 "Mr. House never spoke about the Vault directly, he kept his cards close to his chest and revealed as little as possible. Only with Yes Man's assistance was Benny able to uncover the truth behind the Platinum Chip - the reason he killed the courier for it. Now all the work that went into betraying House would come to fruition: Benny would get his army."
 nf_vegas.47.a:0 "Time to grease some palms"
 nf_vegas.48.t:0 "Foul Business"
 nf_vegas.48.d:0 "Caesar's Legion is widely regarded as one of the safest and most profitable parts of the wasteland to trade in. Caravans often make their way throughout Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado completely free of raider interference. As such many traders don't even bring bodyguards - knowing that the Legion itself guarantees their safety via its existence. The only caveat in this enticing business deal is that the Legion doesn't allow the sale of drugs or advanced medicine in their land, among other things. This has made them unpopular with many traders in the Mojave, but today signifies the first major trade deal signed off by the three families. A large caravan comprising of traders and numerous bodyguards will stop off at the Fort briefly before continuing on their way through the Legion. The pretence for the guards is that the caravan plans to eventually leave Legion lands, but the truth is much more sinister..."
 nf_vegas.48.a:0 "Ever seen a 12.7 SMG, Legionary?"
 nf_vegas.49.t:0 "Trojan Horse"
 nf_vegas.49.d:0 "The Fort erupted into chaos as the bodyguards and caravaners pulled their guns on the legionaries. The recruits that had been assigned to keep an eye on the caravan were torn to shreds in mere moments, the well armed group mowing down the men around them in a spray of blood and gore. The setting sun cast a ghastly orange shade across the scene as reinforcements appeared across the ridge, the spilled blood filling their tribal veins with a savagery few live through. As the ranks began to fill out with decanus and centurions, the caravaners looked to Benny for advice - only to find him missing. Perhaps one or two glimpsed his figure at the top of the hill, briefly looking down at them, before it slithered over the ridge and into the camp proper. His promise of a small legion force had been a lie, his declaration that these cast-offs would be allowed back into the families was hollow. Distant machinery screamed to life, an army mobilised beneath the Legion's feet, and Benny was already halfway across the Dam. Pulling out his lighter, the snake had a celebratory smoke as he listened to the sound of gunfire slowly dwindle to silence."
 nf_vegas.49.a:0 "Dead nobodies face down in the dirt."
 nf_vegas.13.t:0 "Ain't That a Kick in the Head"
 nf_vegas.13.d:0 "Yes Man gave Benny all the information he needed: the courier would pass through Goodsprings on their way to Vegas. They waited for their quarry impatiently—eager to get the deed over with—until they finally arrived. It wasn't a fancy affair, the courier was jumped, tied up, and dug a shallow grave while they were still breathing. Maybe some of the men with Benny had an issue with his methods, or maybe they didn't - only the courier, Benny, and his men will ever know.''Time to cash out'', Benny said as he dropped his cigarette, turning to face his victim. He slipped his hand inside his suit pocket, removing the platinum chip and flashing it to the courier. ''You've made your last delivery kid'' Concealing the chip back inside his suit, he removed an engraved pistol in its place. ''Sorry you got twisted up in this scene.'' He stared the courier in the eyes as he spoke, his victim distracted by the weapon at his side. ''From where you're kneeling it must seem like an 18-carat run of bad luck.'' He raised his pistol up at the courier's forehead.''Truth is...''"
 nf_vegas.13.a:0 "''...The game was rigged from the start.''"
 nf_vegas.17.t:0 "Securitron Vault"
 nf_vegas.17.d:0 "Sleeping beneath the earth across from Hoover Dam, in a facility unlike any other, my army of Securitrons await their activation signal - slumbering beneath and old world weather monitoring station. With the platinum chip I can upgrade them all, activate them, and instruct the facility to begin constructing more securitrons. All I need to do is deliver the chip to the vault physically, and the automated processes will do the rest."
 nf_vegas.17.a:0 "One of my henchmen can go in disguise."
 nf_vegas.17.b:0 "I'll send a task force in and cause a distraction."
 nf_vegas.23.t:0 "The King's Infiltration"
 nf_vegas.23.d:0 " The King wasn't an immediately obvious choice, but his time cultivating a loyal following made him an excellent speaker. However, despite being in full legionary kit, I worry that the King will stand out as an unusually conscious legionary. He can slip into the vault easily, but whether or not he can fool the legion remains to be seen."
 nf_vegas.23.a:0 "Now I must wait."
 nf_vegas.24.t:0 "Benny's Infiltration"
 nf_vegas.24.d:0 "I sent Benny to infiltrate the Legion's camp across from the Dam. It was easy enough to find a uniform for him; dead Legionaries are ubiquitous. Benny's skills of persuasion made slipping into the camp easy enough, but whether or not he would manage to enter the vault remained to be seen."
 nf_vegas.24.a:0 "Now I must wait."
 nf_vegas.25.t:0 "Firefight on Fortification Hill"
 nf_vegas.25.d:0 " "
 nf_vegas.25.a:0 "Full assault - spare northing."
 nf_vegas.25.b:0 "I'll send a few divisions for the assault."
 nf_vegas.25.c:0 "Actually, do I need the securitron diversion...?"
 nf_vegas.26.t:0 "Securitron Army"
 nf_vegas.26.d:0 "Securitrons rolled over the concrete of the Dam, monitors illuminating the night as they stared up at the Fort looming above. Firing at the few legionaries found outside the gates, they set about tearing down the defences to allow themselves in. Already large portions of the camp had roused from their slumber—distant battle cries made this apparent—and reinforcements were pouring down to the breach. Despite this, the small task force of well armed mercs that House had hired to storm the weather station managed to slip through the hellish battle. The few that made it inside faced even worse opponents, and the only man to make it through the hail of sentry bot gunfire inserted the chip as asked; spending his dying moments slumped against a wall, watching the securitrons being assembled and thinking of the promised payment as his blood ran cold."
 nf_vegas.26.a:0 "My army is ready; now it's time for true progress."
