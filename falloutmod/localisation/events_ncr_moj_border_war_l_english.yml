 NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.t:0 "Preparing Attack Against Brotherhood"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.d:0 "After the long retreat of the Brotherhood's Army, they have managed to regroup and establish themselves in The Hidden Valley. We need to strike against the Brotherhood and seize the Mojave."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.a:0 "Strongarm local warlords into the offensive."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.b:0 "Recruit local outlaws to fight for us."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.c:0 "Rely on local volunteers who oppose the Brotherhood."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.tt:0 "§YIf the Mojave Brotherhood chooses to confront the attack:§!\n"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.1.tt_2:0 "§YIf the Mojave Brotherhood chooses to retreat:§!\n"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.t:0 "NCR Launch Offensive"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.d:0 "The NCR are not planning to let us grow stronger without more confrontations. Our spies suggest they are mounting an offensive against us, which could weaken our political support if we try to retreat further.\n\nWe don't know how committed the NCR are to pushing us back right now. Trying to confront them carries significant risks. If the local warlords have been rallied to support the attack, our chances may be slim. On the other hand, retreating now when we have finally stopped may not be an option."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.a:0 "Confront the attack with whatever means we can afford!"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.2.b:0 "Retreat into isolation."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.3.t:0 "Brotherhood Retreat"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.3.d:0 "Discovering our planned offensive through their local spy network, the Mojave Brotherhood have withdrawn their Brotherhood Troops further into Hidden Valley. Although this deprived us of the opportunity to further weaken their numbers, this has shown that the Brotherhood are not ready to confront us, despite what their propaganda says. To some extent, the effort has still worked to our benefit."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.3.a:0 "Cowards!"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.4.t:0 "Victory Against Brotherhood"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.4.d:0 "Our commitment to routing the Brotherhood Troops has been successful, at least for now. Despite gaining information about the attack, the Brotherhood decided to confront our forces and lost. They have now been forced to withdraw further and many of the locals have grown skeptical of their ability to deliver on their promises of overthrowing our government."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.4.a:0 "And rightly so!"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.5.t:0 "Brotherhood Repel Attack"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.5.d:0 "Having gained information about our plans to launch an offensive beforehand, the Brotherhood Troops was prepared and confronted our attack. The troops we had managed to assemble in this area, where our power base is weak, were insufficient to defeat the Brotherhood forces. \nSadly, the attack has been turned against us and seen as a sign of the Brotherhood Troops's recovery after their long retreat."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.5.a:0 "It won't help them in the long run."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.6.t:0 "Defeat Against the NCR"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.6.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to repel the attack of locally assembled troops supporting the NCR government, our preparations were insufficient to stop it. With significant losses, we have been forced into a new retreat, albeit shorter.\n\nConfronting the outsiders before we had fully recovered may have been a mistake. Our magnificent recovery in the Long March instilled hope in our supporters, but now, seeds of doubt have been sown."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.6.a:0 "We will recover and win the faith of the people again."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.7.t:0 "Victory Against the NCR"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.7.d:0 "Challenging the NCR offensive has worked in our favor. The locally assembled troops sent to confront the Brotherhood Troops were not prepared for our knowledge of the impending attack and were defeated, all serving as a warning to nearby warlords that attacking us can be costly. \n\nThe outsiders have only proven that they underestimate us as a foe, and that the People's Republic is once again on the rise."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.7.a:0 "Political Power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.t:0 "Clash with Brotherhood Guerrillas"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.d:0 "With both us and the Brotherhood Troops barely having recovered from our previous offensive, our mutual troop presence close to the border has reignited the conflict. In addition to the local warlords and militias, we have considered moving in more troops from elsewhere.\n\nAlthough this may not give us opportunity to crush the Brotherhood menace once and for all, it would be an important ideological victory to show that they will not be allowed to expand further."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.a:0 "We must draw the line now!"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.8.b:0 "We can't afford another confrontation."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.9.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.9.d:0 "Despite our efforts to push show that the Brotherhood will not be allowed to expand their influence outside of where they have currently taken refuge, we could not afford to commit enough resources to win the conflict along the [From.GetName] border.\n\nThe sporadic conflicts with Brotherhood militias slowly turned out more and more in their favor, which in the end made the campaign a failure in demonstrating that we have the situation under control. If their strength keeps increasing, the Brotherhood could turn out to be a genuine threat."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.9.a:0 "Troubling."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.10.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.10.d:0 "After a number of smaller encounters in the outskirts of our controlled territory, the conflict with the NCR appears to have turned to our advantage. Although maintaining constant pressure has been taxing on our troops and supplies, the effort has been worthwhile. \n\nNo decisive battles have been fought, we have won a slow victory this time, which has strengthened the faith in our cause and fanned the flames of the revolution once again."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.10.a:0 "This will not be soon forgotten!"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.11.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.11.d:0 "Our efforts to wage an indirect war against the increased NCR presence has proven disastrous. The outsiders were simply more dedicated to pushing us back than we thought, perhaps expecting the impact this failure would have on our reputation. Although our army is once again safe to recover, for now, the losses have not gone unnoticed by the locals, and rumors of the failure of the revolution are already spreading to nearby villages."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.11.a:0 "The revolution is far from dead!"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.12.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.12.d:0 "Our efforts to draw the line against the threat of the Brotherhood have been successful. The Mojave Brotherhoods guerrilla campaigns in response to our increased troop presence in regions surrounding their power base failed to anticipate our dedication to stopping them. This show of strength, although not entirely without costs, has convinced many of the locals who previously gave their tacit support to [From.GetLeader] and his party have now begun to realize that the Mojave can never be united under such an ideology."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.12.a:0 "Let us hope they remember."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.13.t:0 "Clash with NCR Army"
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.13.d:0 "While we have still barely recovered from their previous offensive, the outsiders appear to be increasing their troop presence in the areas close to our border. Clearly, they are trying to show that they once again have us contained and that the Great March only delayed their final strike against the Mojave Brotherhood. We cannot let the people think this is true."
 NCR_MOJ_border_war.13.a:0 "We cannot afford to spend our time recovering."
