 #-------------------------------------
 ces_expedition_to_blackfoot: "Expedition To Blackfoot"
 ces_expedition_to_blackfoot_desc: "The expedition to the Blackfoot tribe was the defining event of Legion history. The tribe is the foundation of Caesar's great Legion, and it was through the flames of this primitive's tribes wars that the iron will of Caesar was forged."
 
 ces_death_in_the_canyons: "Death In The Canyons"
 ces_death_in_the_canyons_desc: "The earliest years of the Legion were also some of the most brutal. In his conquest of the Canyons, Caesar brutally slaughtered three of the local tribes, each act just as cruel. But one act gained particular infamy in the wastes."
 
 ces_the_malpais_legate: "The Malpais Legate"
 ces_the_malpais_legate_desc: "Joshua Graham, the Malpais Legate, was the co-founder of the Legion, and Caesar's greatest servant. A shrewd, cunning general - this early act cemented his legend across the Legion, and formed the basis of his military prowess."
 
 ces_caesar_son_of_mars: "Caesar, Son Of Mars"
 ces_caesar_son_of_mars_desc: "Caesar's will is law. He is a god amongst men, the son of the god of war, Mars. All in his legion live to serve him, as a blade serves his master. He is the teacher and master of the tribes under him - and in his conquest, taught them many lessons."
 
 # Alea Iacta Est sub-tree
 ces_alea_iacta_est: "Alea Iacta Est"
 ces_alea_iacta_est_desc: "Alea Iacta Est, the die is cast, the words spoken by Caesar's namesake as he stood against Rome. These are the words that began the immortal empire, the words that again shall begin a great empire of Caesar's."
 
 ces_the_hangdogs: "The Hangdogs"
 ces_the_hangdogs_desc: "In the ruined city of Denver, now called Dog City, the Hangdog tribe roams with packs of vicious dogs. They worship these dogs, and believe they are spiritually bound to them."
 
 ces_shottol_god_of_dogs: "Shottol, God of Dogs"
 ces_shottol_god_of_dogs_desc: "Alongside the Hangdogs' belief they are spiritually linked with dogs, they believe in a great canine god named Shottol, and the tribals from the Hangdogs clamor for their god. We may embrace this god into our pantheon."
 
 ces_legion_mongrels: "Legion Mongrels"
 ces_legion_mongrels_desc: "The Hangdogs tribe had an impressive mastery of dogs, and with their tribe fully assimilated, we can use great divisions with wardogs in our Legion. The wardogs are great for breaking enemy lines."
 
 ces_the_twin_mothers: "The Twin Mothers"
 ces_the_twin_mothers_desc: "The Twin Mothers are a backwards tribe, where the women rule and they worship a false goddess named 'Diana'. They are renowned for their focus on education and healing."
 
 ces_goddess_diana: "Goddess Diana"
 ces_goddess_diana_desc: "The Twin Mothers tribe we have recently enslaved persist in their belief that their goddess Diana is real. Often, they refuse to bind Legionnaire's wounds in protest. Acknowledging their godess as Caesar's equal may subdue them."
 
 ces_caesar_the_godslayer: "Caesar the Godslayer"
 ces_caesar_the_godslayer_desc: "Caesar will teach the Twin Mothers their final lesson. Their goddess is nothing more than an illusion - and can be slain. With their tribe broken and enslaved, they will be chained to Caesar's will - and used as healers for the Legion."
 
 ces_two_sun: "Two Sun"
 ces_two_sun_desc: "The city of Two Sun is home to a band of roaving tribals, who use restored vehicles to race through the ruined highrises. Their mastery of motor vehicles is known throughout the Legion."
 
 ces_the_cult_of_nas: "The Cult of Nas"
 ces_the_cult_of_nas_desc: "The recently conquered tribe of Two Sun worshipped a god they called 'Nas' - the god that purportedly gave them their vehicles and the skills to use it. If we allow worship of this god, they will retain their great skill at driving."
 
 ces_taming_the_city: "Taming the City"
 ces_taming_the_city_desc: "With the Two Sun tribe defeated, it is left to the Legion to tame the vehicles of the city. With the tribe in our rankings, elite vehicle units can be conscripted into the Legion."
 
 ces_cochise_county_cowboys: "Cochise County Cowboys"
 ces_cochise_county_cowboys_desc: "The Cochise County Cowboys are a tribe that worship old world symbols of 'cowboys'. They intercept local travellers and caravans frequently - and have a unique skill in guerilla warfare."
 
 ces_wyatt_the_demon: "Wyatt the Demon"
 ces_wyatt_the_demon_desc: "The Cochise County Cowboys revere an ancient figure they call Wyatt The Demon. His servants are the most elite of the cowboys, outlaws with a keen sense of survival. If we embrace this Wyatt they may bolster our army."
 
 ces_legion_outlaws: "Legion Outlaws"
 ces_legion_outlaws_desc: "The Cochise County Cowboys we recently assimilated could be a great boon to the Legion when used as outlaws and rangers, with a unique knowledge of the land and guerilla tactics."
 
 ces_temple_of_shottol: "Temple of Shottol"

 ces_the_twin_temples: "The Twin Temples"
 ces_the_twin_temples_desc: "The followers of Diana petition for a temple to be constructed in their old tribal lands. Here, they seek to teach of Diana, and promote learning and education across the Legion."
 
 ces_nas_scriptures: "Propagate Nas' Scriptures"
 ces_nas_scriptures_desc: "Among the vehicular Two Sun tribe, scripture from their god Nas, really old auto manuals from pre-war, have been circulating as divine gospel. If we help propagate this scripture, our production of vehicles will improve."
 ces_demon_servants: "The Demon's Servants"
 
 ces_demon_servants_desc: "The so called 'Servents Of Wyatt' are an elite band amongst the Cochise Country tribe - some of the finest scouts and warriors even the Legion has encountered. With the integration of Wyatt into our pantheon, they will join our Legion."

 ces_conqueror_of_the_86: "Conqueror of The 86"
 ces_conqueror_of_the_86_desc: "With these final tribals conquered, the Legion is now made up of 86. An impressive title, the feat of conquering and assimilating 86 tribes is unprecedented in the Wasteland."
 
 # Brotherhood sub-tree
 ces_the_brotherhood_of_steel: "The Brotherhood of Steel"
 ces_the_brotherhood_of_steel_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel are a backwards, insane tribe. They're the worst of humanity, horders - scavengers dressed in trappings of chivalry. They offer no future, they're a dead end."
 
 ces_smoke_out_the_rats: "Smoke Out the Rats"
 ces_smoke_out_the_rats_desc: "The Mojave Brotherhood hides in a bunker in the mojave desert. We will seize the desert, until our frumentarii can find them, or we can bait them to come out of their bunker."
 
 ces_annex_hidden_valley: "Annex Hidden Valley"
 ces_annex_hidden_valley_desc: "With the Mojave Brotherhood defeated, the Legion now controls Hidden Valley and the surrounding desert. Annexing this into the Legion, providing some colonists and infrastructure, will give us a base in the Mojave."
 
 ces_broken_steel: "Broken Steel"
 ces_broken_steel_desc: "The Brotherhood has been defeated, broken under foot. The experience and power projection gained from this historic defeat simply shows how powerful the Legion is."
 
 ces_enslaving_the_scribes: "Enslaving the Scribes"
 ces_enslaving_the_scribes_desc: "Though it has been hard, breaking the Brotherhood scribes' will has been a great boon for scientific advancement in the Legion, as we can learn their secrets of energy weapons and power armour."
 
 ces_the_last_knight: "The Last Knight"
 ces_the_last_knight_desc: "One member of the Brotherhood in particular resisted us for a long time, until we managed to capture and commit him to the gladiator arena. Though we had hoped he would meet his death in the arena, he has fought valiantly against everything we throw at him."
 
 ces_deconstructing_perfection: "Deconstructing Perfection"
 ces_deconstructing_perfection_desc: "With all the salvaged power armour parts we have gained from defeating the Mojave Brotherhood, we can potentially construct our own power armour with greater ease, though the use of servos is still a mystery to us."
 
 ces_honour_the_steelbreakers: "Honour the Steelbreakers"
 ces_honour_the_steelbreakers_desc: "The legendary legion that was succesful in cracking the Brotherhood's bunker and defeating them in combat has become legendary as the 'Steelbreakers'."
 
 # Tribal sub-tree
 ces_new_judea: "New Judea"
 ces_new_judea_desc: "The Rome of old once conquered the province of Judea - then Israel, where Christianity was born. The Mormons, building a New Canaan in Utah, seem to be inviting a New Judea upon themselves."
 
 ces_the_white_leg_petition: "The White Legs Petition"
 ces_the_white_leg_petition_desc: "The White Legs, a nearby tribe, have repeatedly petitioned to join the Legion. As we now have a use for them, we should allow them to join in future, so long as they attack the New Canaanites for us."
 
 ces_white_legs_accept: "Reward the Loyal Tribe"
 ces_white_legs_accept_desc: "Let it not be said that Caesar does not reward loyalty. The White Legs, thanks to their loyalty in helping to attack the Canaanites, should be rewarded, and promised eventual assimilation."
 
 ces_white_legs_refuse: "Calling upon the Nomads"
 ces_white_legs_refuse_desc: "The White Legs have failed us, refusing to attack the Canaanites. Such insolence will not go unpunished. Another tribe in Utah, the nomadic 80s, can be used as a tool, to remove the Canaanites and later, the White Legs."
 
 ces_weapons_of_war: "Weapons Of War"
 ces_weapons_of_war_desc: "The war on the Canaanites has granted a boon in industry to our ally, and even to ourselves, as we have to provide weapons to our tribal allies."
 
 ces_graham_execution: "Graham's Execution"
 ces_graham_execution_desc: "With the New Canaanites defeated, Joshua Graham, the Malpais Legate, the Burned Man, has been brought to Caesar. To finally quench the rumours of the Burned Man - Graham will be publicly crucified."
 
 ces_new_cohort: "New Cohort"
 ces_new_cohort_desc: "The White Legs have loyally served us in the war, defeating the New Canaanites and delivering Graham to us. They will be welcomed into the Legion, and granted dominion over Utah."
 
 ces_new_auxilliary: "New Auxilliary"
 ces_new_auxilliary_desc: "Despite the betrayal from the White Legs, the 80s tribe, an unexpected ally, defeated New Canaan. They will be welcomed into the Legion, and granted dominion over Utah."
 
 ces_legionary_utah: "Legionary Utah"
 ces_legionary_utah_desc: "Utah is not deserving of any petty tribe, ally or not. Only the Legion can claim dominion over Utah, and we will bring all the local tribes to heel, incorporated under Caesar."
 
 # NCR sub-tree
 ces_crossing_the_rubicon: "Crossing The Rubicon"
 ces_crossing_the_rubicon_desc: "Caesar's ancient namesake once crossed a river named the Rubicon, an unprecedented move that pitted him against Rome so that he could usurp it as Emperor. Similairly, our Legion crossing the Colorado River signifies total war."
 
 ces_war_for_hoover_dam: "War For Hoover Dam"
 ces_war_for_hoover_dam_desc: "The Dam is our only way into Nevada, into the Mojave - where our Rome lies, New Vegas. The Dam is also a spectacular prize, but all of this has been claimed by the Bear. We must go to war with the NCR to claim the Dam back."
 
 ces_the_burned_man: "The Burned Man"
 ces_the_burned_man_desc: "The war for the Dam was lost, and somebody must be held responsible. Joshua Graham, once the most esteemed general in the Legion, was largely at fault for the failed offensive. An example must be made of him."
 
 ces_triumph_at_the_dam: "Triumph At The Dam"
 ces_triumph_at_the_dam_desc: "With the war won, a triumph should be held, in ancient Roman tradition, as a celebration of our victory over the NCR. It will take place at Hoover Dam, and the Legion Bull will be displayed proudly, facing towards Vegas."
 
 ces_lick_the_bulls_wounds: "Lick The Bull's Wounds"
 ces_lick_the_bulls_wounds_desc: "The war for Hoover Dam left us wounded - with many lost in the attempt for the Dam. More legionaries must be trained to make up for the fallen, as we regather our strength."
 
 ces_fortify_the_dam: "Fortify The Dam"
 ces_fortify_the_dam_desc: "Hoover Dam is naturally a heavily fortified location - but as such an important strategic location, we can afford to be over-cautious. Upping the legionaries assigned to the Dam, and constructing fortified towers - will make it harder to siege."
 
 ces_fortification_hill: "The Fort"
 ces_fortification_hill_desc: "Fortification Hill, just before the Dam, is a prime location to begin the rebuilding of forces to retake the Dam. We should construct a camp there, to train new legionaries and command from."
 
 ces_the_rubicon_is_crossed: "The Rubicon Is Crossed"
 ces_the_rubicon_is_crossed_desc: "With the Dam taken, and Colorado crossed, Caesar has fulfilled his crossing of the Rubicon. This is a symbol of Caesar's will to total war in the West. All beyond the Colorado will be his in time."
 
 ces_crossing_the_colorado: "Crossing The Colorado"
 ces_crossing_the_colorado_desc: "With our first attempt being less successful, perhaps another method of crossing the colorado could be explored. Ports will be constructed along the river to mount some naval assaults."
 
 ces_to_the_victor_go_the_spoils: "To The Victor, Go The Spoils"
 ces_to_the_victor_go_the_spoils_desc: "With the Dam consolidated under our power, we can begin to transfer its resources to our capital. This will create a great influx of water and electricity in Flagstaff."
 
 ces_poking_the_bear: "Poking The Bear"
 ces_poking_the_bear_desc: "The New California Republic is our main enemy, the final massive conquest of the Legion. The Bear lies in hibernation, only outstretching a paw into the Mojave. We must wake the bear from its slumber, so we can do battle."
 
 # Mexico sub-tree
 ces_mexico_expansion: "Mexican Expansion"
 ces_mexico_expansion_desc: "South of Caesar's territory is the land of Mexico. It is a prime point of expansion, with many weak tribes and nations. Should the Legion's army find themselves in Mexico, their conquest would be easy."
 
 ces_baudelio_ranchers: "The Baudelio Ranchers"
 ces_baudelio_ranchers_desc: "The Baudelio Ranchers are a peaceful group of settlers who occupy a large swathe of land called the Baudelio. They would not stand a chance against the Legion."

 ces_enslave_the_ranchers: "Enslave The Ranchers"
 ces_enslave_the_ranchers_desc: "The Ranchers of Baudelio were exceptional at grazing Brahmin and taming Bighorners. If we enslave them, they can continue to produce food and other goods for the Legion."
 
 ces_baudelio_wells: "The Baudelio Wells"
 ces_baudelio_wells_desc: "All across the Baudelio, to aid with their Brahmin raising, the Baudelio Ranchers constructed wells, tapping into the only semi-radiated underground springs of water."
 
 ces_reorganise_the_ranches: "Reorganise The Ranches"

 ces_enslaving_the_colonists: "Enslaving the Colonists"
 ces_enslaving_the_colonists_desc: "The colonists of Pecos were exceptional at carpentry. If we enslave them, they can continue to produce wares and other goods for the Legion."
 
 ces_purpose_for_pecos: "Purpose For Pecos"
 ces_purpose_for_pecos_desc: "Oil wells have been discovered in the Pecos region. Let us repurpose the colonists there, making them extract oil for use in our military."
 
 ces_assimilate_the_people: "Assimilate The People"
 ces_assimilate_the_people_desc: "Legionaries should be sent in to reorganise the colony under direct control of the Legion - ensuring that all of the goods can be redistributed by Legion officials."
 
 ces_the_lights_of_vegas: "The Lights Of Vegas"
 ces_the_lights_of_vegas_desc: "The Lights of Vegas shine from end to end of the Mojave wastes. A beacon to some, a target for us. To build our Nova Roma, we must first wrest control of New Vegas from Mr House and the Families."
 
 ces_the_eternal_city: "The Eternal City"
 ces_the_eternal_city_desc: "Just as the city of ancient Rome was once described as 'the Eternal City' - so shall New Vegas. The Strip never closes, and the caps never stop flowing."
 
 ces_caesers_palace: "Caesar's Palace"
 ces_caesers_palace_desc: "Deep in the ruined parts of the Strip, a casino called 'Caesar's Palace' has been unearthed. It seems it was almost destiny for the Legion to take the Strip, and discover this palace. Caesar has taken the casino as his seat of power, and begun reconstruction efforts."
 
 ces_open_the_lucky_38: "Break The Bank"
 ces_open_the_lucky_38_desc: "The Lucky 38 stands tall, watching over the Strip. Inside, Mr House must have housed many treasures and, as it has not been opened since before the war, much pre-war technology."
 
 ces_expand_the_via_militaris: "Expand The Via Militaris"
 ces_expand_the_via_militaris_desc: "With our conquests in the Mojave won, and our frontier pushed to Vegas - the Via Militaris should be expanded into the Strip, for easier access for our soldiers."
 
 ces_mccarran_airstrip: "McCarran Airstrip"
 ces_mccarran_airstrip_desc: "Outside Freeside is the McCarran Airstrip, seized from the NCR after Vegas was conquered. With some work put in, this could be the base of a Legionary Air Force."
 
 ces_scouring_the_strip: "Scourging The Strip"
 ces_scouring_the_strip_desc: "The Strip was once used by the NCR to improve morale by its soldiers. Such decadence and debauchery is uncharacteristic of a proper military force, so we will scourge the Strip, and use it to arm our soldiers."
 
 ces_nova_roma: "Nova Roma"
 ces_nova_roma_desc: "New Vegas, now fully under Legion control, and repurposed to house our seat of government, is ready to be occupied. Already, many flock to the outlying areas to settle, as Caesar moves his court here from Flagstaff."
 
 ces_peace: "Pax Per Bellum"
 ces_peace_desc: "Pax Per Bellum. 'Peace through War' - an ancient Roman saying used to justify their conquests of the known world. Peace can only be achieved by holding dominion over all people, by all living under one banner."
 
 ces_a_worthy_foe: "A Worthy Foe"
 ces_a_worthy_foe_desc: "For the first time, the Legion has encountered a foe perhaps more powerful than itself, and the first foe that Caesar is ideologically opposed to. The NCR is, indeed, a worthy foe for Caesar's fledgling Legion."
 
 ces_divide_et_impera: "Divide Et Impera"
 ces_divide_et_impera_desc: "Divide Et Impera, or 'divide and conquer' - is the principle of dividing a larger power into smaller powers, in order to better conquer or rule over the parts. By attacking key areas of the NCR, we can weaken them enough to be more easily conquered."
 
 ces_camp_searchlight: "Camp Searchlight"
 ces_camp_searchlight_desc: "Vulpes Inculta has come to us with a plan. The NCR Camp in the town of Searchlight could easily be sabotaged by opening some irradiated barrels of nuclear waste inside the town, irradiating the town and the NCR soldiers within."
 
 ces_battle_of_nelson: "Battle Of Nelson"
 ces_battle_of_nelson_desc: "The town of Nelson, though only small, could prove an extremely important strategic point to launch assaults on the NCR in Mojave. By expending some manpower to take, we can seize the town as a base across the Colorado."
 
 ces_in_hoc_signo_taurus_vinces: "In Hoc Signo Taurus Vinces"
 ces_in_hoc_signo_taurus_vinces_desc: "In the sign of the bull, we shall conquer. The NCR will fall beneath the might of the Legion, and its lands will be conquered. All the preparation has been taken, and it is time to declare war."
 
 ces_render_unto_caesar: "Render Unto Caesar"

 ces_thesis: "The New Thesis"
 ces_thesis_desc: "Caesar lived, despite his dehabilitating disease, in part due to specialised technology and excellent healers. Now, with his rule over the Legion consolidated, Caesar can implement his philosophy and instate the New Thesis, a combination of the Legion and NCR."
 
 ces_brotherhood: "Brotherhood Of Mars"
 ces_brotherhood_desc: "In the gruelling civil war that followed Caesar's revival, the legions of the Brotherhood of Mars successfully overthrew Caesar and threw off the shackles he had placed on technology. Now, Lucius stands to reform the Legion as a technologically advanced nation."
 
 ces_spqr: "S.P.Q.R."
 ces_spqr_desc: "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Vulpes Inculta emerged victorious. This move will likely mean the Legion becoming less of a military force, but Vulpes Inculta has many strengths of his own."
 
 ces_lanius: "Monster Of The East"
 ces_lanius_desc: "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Legate Lanius, the rightful heir of Caesar, emerged victorious. Though some criticise his barbaric methods, he is undoubtedly a fierce commander and great conqueror."

 ces_brotherhoodslaves: "Brotherhood Slaves"
 ces_brotherhoodslaves_desc: "Luckily, some of our captured slaves were also once members of the Brotherhood of Steel. Though they are tough to crack, we could recieve much information about pre-war weaponry and technology from them."
