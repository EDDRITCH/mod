 ces.1.t:0 "The Sacking of New Canaan"
 ces.1.d:0 "As ordered by Caesar, the White Legs Tribe have attacked and destroyed New Canaan. They have slaughtered the Mormons and razed the city to the ground, that they then salted to ensure there could never be any growth. One of the terms of their attack on New Canaan was absorption into the Legion. What is the Caesar's will?"
 ces.1.a:0 "They have done as ordered, absorb them."
 ces.1.b:0 "But the Malpais Legate escaped, they have failed."
 
 ces.2.t:0 "Caesar's Death"
 ces.2.d:0 "Today, Caesar, our glorious leader, passed away. The heir apparent is Legate Lanius, but he is a brutal man and many are critical of his leadership.

 ces.6.t:0 "The Boomers"
 ces.6.d:0 "The Boomers' artillery will be incredibly useful when attacking Hoover Dam. If their opinion of us is high enough, we can ally with them. Otherwise, we can take their artillery by force."
 ces.6.a:0 "Ally with them."
 ces.6.b:0 "Take it with force."
 
 ces.7.t:0 "New Vegas"
 ces.7.d:0 "The Omertas have been Legion agents for quite some time, now, if we can blackmail the White Glove Society, who we know to be cannibals, onto our side, then we could have a significant foothold in New Vegas that would help us win the 2nd Battle of Hoover Dam"
 ces.7.a:0 "Blackmail them."
 ces.7.b:0 "No, we will take Vegas by force!"
    
 ces.8.t:0 "Kill President Kimball"
 ces.8.d:0 "With the battle for Hoover Dam on the horizon, we could assasinate the NCR leader, President Aaron Kimball, to destabilize them somewhat and make them easier to conquer."

 ces.8.b:0 "There is no honour in assasination."
